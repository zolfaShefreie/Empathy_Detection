Junk food can make you depressed. And being depressed probably makes you eat more junk food? For a while that was my problem too. Even if its just random, ill probably binge and feel bad later. Only to indulge in more later to try to cheer up.   \n",

Depression is an actual mental disorder which commonly goes untreated. The best things you can do for depression is first of all, not hiding it, tell your loved ones so they can help you. also get a therapist, very helpful and help you cope with depression and get over it. If you think really bad you can see a doctor and see if medication is a good idea. I take antidepressants and my depression is gone, it change you like I originally thought it would, it just makes me the same but not sad all the time.   \n",

              "3081  I probably would have considered bringing harm to myself and others if not for writing. Do you write? I find it helpful to seal away any self-detrimental desires inside characters who are not me. If you purge all of your thoughts out of your head and onto the page, you might find some relief. Literature is one of the most important inventions for resolving issues and you may find purpose through writing for yourself. My life is not pleasant by any means so I created the life that I want in my writing. My life became better through writing. What ideas and notions could be lost if you left us so soon? What adventures could you go on in your own book? Think of all the memories that could be shared. You could even write about a role-model. Mine is Typhon, the Greek dragon under the mountain. I obsess over this mad titan to keep myself calm. He shows up in all of my work. My advice would be to pound that pain out into a character, a mighty simulacrum, an indestructible artifact to contain your every fear. I'm not sure if I'm phrasing this well enough to help, but this is the only way I know how to express myself.   \n",

              "4     I hate not knowing why. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety when I was 14. That's almost 4 years ago and I still don't know why I am like this. I have more than enough, yet there are moments where I feel like there's no hope nor a bright future waiting for me. I feel alone and abandoned even though I have friends who know that I am depressed and am like this sometimes. I get so frustrated when I can't find out why I just can't be normal. Everything was alright about 2 hours ago, but it just changes so quickly and hard that I almost feel suicidal. I'm a fucking mess...   \n",

Junk food can make you depressed. And being depressed probably makes you eat more junk food? For a while that was my problem too. Even if its just random, ill probably binge and feel bad later. Only to indulge in more later to try to cheer up.   \n",

Depression is an actual mental disorder which commonly goes untreated. The best things you can do for depression is first of all, not hiding it, tell your loved ones so they can help you. also get a therapist, very helpful and help you cope with depression and get over it. If you think really bad you can see a doctor and see if medication is a good idea. I take antidepressants and my depression is gone, it change you like I originally thought it would, it just makes me the same but not sad all the time.   \n",

              "3081  I probably would have considered bringing harm to myself and others if not for writing. Do you write? I find it helpful to seal away any self-detrimental desires inside characters who are not me. If you purge all of your thoughts out of your head and onto the page, you might find some relief. Literature is one of the most important inventions for resolving issues and you may find purpose through writing for yourself. My life is not pleasant by any means so I created the life that I want in my writing. My life became better through writing. What ideas and notions could be lost if you left us so soon? What adventures could you go on in your own book? Think of all the memories that could be shared. You could even write about a role-model. Mine is Typhon, the Greek dragon under the mountain. I obsess over this mad titan to keep myself calm. He shows up in all of my work.

              "3081  I probably would have considered bringing harm to myself and others if not for writing. Do you write? I find it helpful to seal away any self-detrimental desires inside characters who are not me. If you purge all of your thoughts out of your head and onto the page, you might find some relief. Literature is one of the most important inventions for resolving issues and you may find purpose through writing for yourself. My life is not pleasant by any means so I created the life that I want in my writing. My life became better through writing. What ideas and notions could be lost if you left us so soon? What adventures could you go on in your own book? Think of all the memories that could be shared. You could even write about a role-model. Mine is Typhon, the Greek dragon under the mountain. I obsess over this mad titan to keep myself calm. He shows up in all of my work. My advice would be to pound that pain out into a character, a mighty simulacrum, an indestructible artifact to contain your every fear. I'm not sure if I'm phrasing this well enough to help, but this is the only way I know how to express myself.   \n",

What adventures could you go on in your own book? Think of all the memories that could be shared. You could even write about a role-model. Mine is Typhon, the Greek dragon under the mountain. I obsess over this mad titan to keep myself calm. He shows up in all of my work. My advice would be to pound that pain out into a character, a mighty simulacrum, an indestructible artifact to contain your every fear. I'm not sure if I'm phrasing this well enough to help, but this is the only way I know how to express myself.</td>\n",

Idk what type of housing you live in (e.g. apt., house, renting, etc.) but that may help cut monthly expenses in some way too if that's something you're looking for. Maybe get a pet if your housing accommodations allow it. Pets really help with loneliness and depression sometimes. People can even actually get their pets registered as official emotional assistance animals. In some cases, they will be allowed to live in certain housing areas in which pets would otherwise not be allowed. Sometimes it's easy to focus on the negative of living alone. But there are tons of good things about it as well. You just gotta look towards those as well.   \n",

              "657   I'm not entirely certain what reaction you're getting, but I hope you'll give those around you a little slack if they can't be as openly receptive and caring as you need at first. I'm sort of the designated problem solver in my circle, so quite a few of my friends come to me for advice and sympathy. It's never, never a burden. Instead, it's an honor. They trust me with their secrets, their problems, and value my opinion enough to ask for it. Reverse the situation. Aren't you glad when someone comes to you? The thing is, not everyone is built for that. Especially, I have found, it can sort of weird people out when the Rock, the Stable One, the One Person In This Messed Up World Who Has Their Stuff Together needs help. I mean, here's the person they go to and they rely on when they need support... and that person needs support. Suddenly you're not Superman anymore and it can be a bit disconcerting. Perhaps try introducing A problem at a time, slowly, and seeing if they can get used to you also being a normal human with issues. Good luck!!   \n",

              "4     I hate not knowing why. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety when I was 14. That's almost 4 years ago and I still don't know why I am like this. I have more than enough, yet there are moments where I feel like there's no hope nor a bright future waiting for me. I feel alone and abandoned even though I have friends who know that I am depressed and am like this sometimes.  I get so frustrated when I can't find out why I just can't be normal. Everything was alright about 2 hours ago, but it just changes so quickly and hard that I almost feel suicidal.  I'm a fucking mess...   \n",

Junk food can make you depressed. And being depressed probably makes you eat more junk food? For a while that was my problem too. Even if its just random, ill probably binge and feel bad later. Only to indulge in more later to try to cheer up.   \n",

Depression is an actual mental disorder which commonly goes untreated. The best things you can do for depression is first of all, not hiding it, tell your loved ones so they can help you. also get a therapist, very helpful and help you cope with depression and get over it. If you think really bad you can see a doctor and see if medication is a good idea. I take antidepressants and my depression is gone, it change you like I originally thought it would, it just makes me the same but not sad all the time.   \n",

              "3081  I probably would have considered bringing harm to myself and others if not for writing. Do you write? I find it helpful to seal away any self-detrimental desires inside characters who are not me. If you purge all of your thoughts out of your head and onto the page, you might find some relief. Literature is one of the most important inventions for resolving issues and you may find purpose through writing for yourself. My life is not pleasant by any means so I created the life that I want in my writing. My life became better through writing. What ideas and notions could be lost if you left us so soon? What adventures could you go on in your own book? Think of all the memories that could be shared. You could even write about a role-model. Mine is Typhon, the Greek dragon under the mountain. I obsess over this mad titan to keep myself calm. He shows up in all of my work.

Junk food can make you depressed. And being depressed probably makes you eat more junk food? For a while that was my problem too. Even if its just random, ill probably binge and feel bad later. Only to indulge in more later to try to cheer up.   \n",

Depression is an actual mental disorder which commonly goes untreated. The best things you can do for depression is first of all, not hiding it, tell your loved ones so they can help you. also get a therapist, very helpful and help you cope with depression and get over it. If you think really bad you can see a doctor and see if medication is a good idea. I take antidepressants and my depression is gone, it change you like I originally thought it would, it just makes me the same but not sad all the time.   \n",

              "3081  I probably would have considered bringing harm to myself and others if not for writing. Do you write? I find it helpful to seal away any self-detrimental desires inside characters who are not me. If you purge all of your thoughts out of your head and onto the page, you might find some relief. Literature is one of the most important inventions for resolving issues and you may find purpose through writing for yourself. My life is not pleasant by any means so I created the life that I want in my writing. My life became better through writing. What ideas and notions could be lost if you left us so soon? What adventures could you go on in your own book? Think of all the memories that could be shared. You could even write about a role-model. Mine is Typhon, the Greek dragon under the mountain. I obsess over this mad titan to keep myself calm. He shows up in all of my work. My advice would be to pound that pain out into a character, a mighty simulacrum, an indestructible artifact to contain your every fear. I'm not sure if I'm phrasing this well enough to help, but this is the only way I know how to express myself.   \n",

              "4     I hate not knowing why. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety when I was 14. That's almost 4 years ago and I still don't know why I am like this. I have more than enough, yet there are moments where I feel like there's no hope nor a bright future waiting for me. I feel alone and abandoned even though I have friends who know that I am depressed and am like this sometimes.  I get so frustrated when I can't find out why I just can't be normal. Everything was alright about 2 hours ago, but it just changes so quickly and hard that I almost feel suicidal.  I'm a fucking mess...   \n",

Junk food can make you depressed. And being depressed probably makes you eat more junk food? For a while that was my problem too. Even if its just random, ill probably binge and feel bad later. Only to indulge in more later to try to cheer up.   \n",

Depression is an actual mental disorder which commonly goes untreated. The best things you can do for depression is first of all, not hiding it, tell your loved ones so they can help you. also get a therapist, very helpful and help you cope with depression and get over it. If you think really bad you can see a doctor and see if medication is a good idea. I take antidepressants and my depression is gone, it change you like I originally thought it would, it just makes me the same but not sad all the time.   \n",

              "3081  I probably would have considered bringing harm to myself and others if not for writing. Do you write? I find it helpful to seal away any self-detrimental desires inside characters who are not me. If you purge all of your thoughts out of your head and onto the page, you might find some relief. Literature is one of the most important inventions for resolving issues and you may find purpose through writing for yourself. My life is not pleasant by any means so I created the life that I want in my writing. My life became better through writing. What ideas and notions could be lost if you left us so soon? What adventures could you go on in your own book? Think of all the memories that could be shared. You could even write about a role-model. Mine is Typhon, the Greek dragon under the mountain. I obsess over this mad titan to keep myself calm. He shows up in all of my work. My advice would be to pound that pain out into a character, a mighty simulacrum, an indestructible artifact to contain your every fear. I'm not sure if I'm phrasing this well enough to help, but this is the only way I know how to express myself.   \n",

I'm 26 with a decent job and live alone with no girlfriend. I tell myself that it's because I don't have a license due to a seizure disorder that I'm striking out with girls, which is probably true is some cases but I can't even see that girl being in one relationship for the rest of her life if she's picky like that.   \n",

I have more than enough, yet there are moments where I feel like there's no hope nor a bright future waiting for me. I feel alone and abandoned even though I have friends who know that I am depressed and am like this sometimes.  I get so frustrated when I can't find out why I just can't be normal. Everything was alright about 2 hours ago, but it just changes so quickly and hard that I almost feel suicidal.  I'm a fucking mess...   \n",

Junk food can make you depressed. And being depressed probably makes you eat more junk food? For a while that was my problem too. Even if its just random, ill probably binge and feel bad later. Only to indulge in more later to try to cheer up.   \n",

Depression is an actual mental disorder which commonly goes untreated. The best things you can do for depression is first of all, not hiding it, tell your loved ones so they can help you. also get a therapist, very helpful and help you cope with depression and get over it. If you think really bad you can see a doctor and see if medication is a good idea. I take antidepressants and my depression is gone, it change you like I originally thought it would, it just makes me the same but not sad all the time.   \n",

              "3081  I probably would have considered bringing harm to myself and others if not for writing. Do you write? I find it helpful to seal away any self-detrimental desires inside characters who are not me. If you purge all of your thoughts out of your head and onto the page, you might find some relief. Literature is one of the most important inventions for resolving issues and you may find purpose through writing for yourself. My life is not pleasant by any means so I created the life that I want in my writing. My life became better through writing. What ideas and notions could be lost if you left us so soon? What adventures could you go on in your own book? Think of all the memories that could be shared. You could even write about a role-model. Mine is Typhon, the Greek dragon under the mountain. I obsess over this mad titan to keep myself calm. He shows up in all of my work. My advice would be to pound that pain out into a character, a mighty simulacrum, an indestructible artifact to contain your every fear. I'm not sure if I'm phrasing this well enough to help, but this is the only way I know how to express myself.   \n",

I'm 26 with a decent job and live alone with no girlfriend. I tell myself that it's because I don't have a license due to a seizure disorder that I'm striking out with girls, which is probably true is some cases but I can't even see that girl being in one relationship for the rest of her life if she's picky like that.   \n",

Suffering from anxiety and depression, and life circumstances kept becoming more and more difficult. Job was going to shit and stressing me out. Money was becoming a bigger and bigger problem at home. Was getting very little sleep between stress and my son not sleeping at night. One day it became too much. Started crying and having a panic attack. Didn't stop until I drank myself to sleep. The next day I was still struggling to function due to feeling incredibly and persistently overwhelmed.

Please use a sterile blade if you're going to cut yourself, and don't go any deeper than just the surface skin. Take it from me as someone who has used self-harm, an infection is not the sort of pain that helps with emotional relief!  I also recommend other methods, there are plenty out there that can cause some pretty gnarly pain but are far, far safer than cutting. Are there any taps in your house that have overly hot water? Boiling water shouldn't be used as it will scald and is just as prone to infection and other nasties as cutting, so just try clenching a fist under the regular hot water for a few seconds. On the other end of the scale I found the grabing an ice cube and squeezing as tight as I could helped! I thought it would just make my hand feel numb, but it creates a localised, sharp unbearable sensation that works wonders to distract me.   \n",

              "657   I'm not entirely certain what reaction you're getting, but I hope you'll give those around you a little slack if they can't be as openly receptive and caring as you need at first. I'm sort of the designated problem solver in my circle, so quite a few of my friends come to me for advice and sympathy. It's never, never a burden. Instead, it's an honor. They trust me with their secrets, their problems, and value my opinion enough to ask for it. Reverse the situation. Aren't you glad when someone comes to you? The thing is, not everyone is built for that. Especially, I have found, it can sort of weird people out when the Rock, the Stable One, the One Person In This Messed Up World Who Has Their Stuff Together needs help. I mean, here's the person they go to and they rely on when they need support... and that person needs support. Suddenly you're not Superman anymore and it can be a bit disconcerting. Perhaps try introducing A problem at a time, slowly, and seeing if they can get used to you also being a normal human with issues. Good luck!!   \n",

              "2899  Cutting the topside of my arms hurt and bled but they clotted pretty quickly. Please use a sterile blade if you're going to cut yourself, and don't go any deeper than just the surface skin. Take it from me as someone who has used self-harm, an infection is not the sort of pain that helps with emotional relief! I also recommend other methods, there are plenty out there that can cause some pretty gnarly pain but are far, far safer than cutting. Are there any taps in your house that have overly hot water? Boiling water shouldn't be used as it will scald and is just as prone to infection and other nasties as cutting, so just try clenching a fist under the regular hot water for a few seconds. On the other end of the scale I found the grabing an ice cube and squeezing as tight as I could helped! I thought it would just make my hand feel numb, but it creates a localised, sharp unbearable sensation that works wonders to distract me.|  \n",

Junk food can make you depressed. And being depressed probably makes you eat more junk food? For a while that was my problem too. Even if its just random, ill probably binge and feel bad later. Only to indulge in more later to try to cheer up.   \n",

Depression is an actual mental disorder which commonly goes untreated. The best things you can do for depression is first of all, not hiding it, tell your loved ones so they can help you. also get a therapist, very helpful and help you cope with depression and get over it. If you think really bad you can see a doctor and see if medication is a good idea. I take antidepressants and my depression is gone, it change you like I originally thought it would, it just makes me the same but not sad all the time.   \n",

              "3022  I probably would have considered bringing harm to myself and others if not for writing. Do you write? I find it helpful to seal away any self-detrimental desires inside characters who are not me. If you purge all of your thoughts out of your head and onto the page, you might find some relief. Literature is one of the most important inventions for resolving issues and you may find purpose through writing for yourself. My life is not pleasant by any means so I created the life that I want in my writing. My life became better through writing. What ideas and notions could be lost if you left us so soon? What adventures could you go on in your own book? Think of all the memories that could be shared. You could even write about a role-model. Mine is Typhon, the Greek dragon under the mountain. I obsess over this mad titan to keep myself calm. He shows up in all of my work. My advice would be to pound that pain out into a character, a mighty simulacrum, an indestructible artifact to contain your every fear. I'm not sure if I'm phrasing this well enough to help, but this is the only way I know how to express myself.   \n",

Junk food can make you depressed. And being depressed probably makes you eat more junk food? For a while that was my problem too. Even if its just random, ill probably binge and feel bad later. Only to indulge in more later to try to cheer up.   \n",

Depression is an actual mental disorder which commonly goes untreated. The best things you can do for depression is first of all, not hiding it, tell your loved ones so they can help you. also get a therapist, very helpful and help you cope with depression and get over it. If you think really bad you can see a doctor and see if medication is a good idea. I take antidepressants and my depression is gone, it change you like I originally thought it would, it just makes me the same but not sad all the time.   \n",

              "6037  Depends what you mean by get caught. Someone would have to report it to police to move you anywhere or if you're under 18 parents can take you to a hospital. Basic detainment is 72 hours (3 days) To ensure you're not a harm to yourself or others. During that time they examine you and see your mental state. If at the end you're not showing signs of danger you are released but given options to stay for further treatment. If you are still a danger you stay and get more treatment. Now say you made an attempt and go to the ER for something, they can't always just detain you. I've been to the ER for atempt of suicide by oversosing on medication. Longest I was there was a few hours. Due to my mental state being stable they had no legal way to hold me loner than I wanted to be there. I got the drugs out of my system then was discharged and went home. There is a ton, a shit ton of misinformation and propaganda around mental illness. Be informed, do real research. Reddit isn't google. You are smart enough to do real research don't just ask strangers online for all the answers. Also get help.   \n",

Sometimes they're willing to give extra credit if you do additional assignments or labs. Also, many teachers will at least pass a student if the student goes to them and shows that they're really making an effort in the class.  One test will not ruin your life. I promise. :)   \n",

If you open up to these people and they through it in your face right after, then you know they aren't real friends. A real friend is willing to sit through peoples problems for hours. I once sat and chatted with a friend about his issues for some 7 odd hours hours just talking till 7am, never gave up on the conversation, he did the same for me a while later down the road when I was having problems. People who aren't willing to talk to you and help you aren't worth keeping around. Believe me there is a friend out there who is willing to listen. I guess do keep in mind that not everyone has infinite patients and has their own problems. good luck out there man hope things go well for you.

I tell myself that it's because I don't have a license due to a seizure disorder that I'm striking out with girls, which is probably true is some cases but I can't even see that girl being in one relationship for the rest of her life if she's picky like that.   \n",

I have more than enough, yet there are moments where I feel like there's no hope nor a bright future waiting for me. I feel alone and abandoned even though I have friends who know that I am depressed and am like this sometimes.  I get so frustrated when I can't find out why I just can't be normal.

Junk food can make you depressed. And being depressed probably makes you eat more junk food? For a while that was my problem too. Even if its just random, ill probably binge and feel bad later. Only to indulge in more later to try to cheer up.   \n",

Depression is an actual mental disorder which commonly goes untreated. The best things you can do for depression is first of all, not hiding it, tell your loved ones so they can help you. also get a therapist, very helpful and help you cope with depression and get over it. If you think really bad you can see a doctor and see if medication is a good idea. I take antidepressants and my depression is gone, it change you like I originally thought it would, it just makes me the same but not sad all the time.   \n",

              "6038  Depends what you mean by get caught. Someone would have to report it to police to move you anywhere or if you're under 18 parents can take you to a hospital. Basic detainment is 72 hours (3 days) To ensure you're not a harm to yourself or others. During that time they examine you and see your mental state. If at the end you're not showing signs of danger you are released but given options to stay for further treatment. If you are still a danger you stay and get more treatment. Now say you made an attempt and go to the ER for something, they can't always just detain you. I've been to the ER for atempt of suicide by oversosing on medication. Longest I was there was a few hours. Due to my mental state being stable they had no legal way to hold me loner than I wanted to be there. I got the drugs out of my system then was discharged and went home. There is a ton, a shit ton of misinformation and propaganda around mental illness. Be informed, do real research. isn't google. You are smart enough to do real research don't just ask strangers online for all the answers. Also get help.   \n",

Sometimes they're willing to give extra credit if you do additional assignments or labs. Also, many teachers will at least pass a student if the student goes to them and shows that they're really making an effort in the class. One test will not ruin your life. I promise. :)   \n",

If you open up to these people and they through it in your face right after, then you know they aren't real friends. A real friend is willing to sit through peoples problems for hours. I once sat and chatted with a friend about his issues for some 7 odd hours hours just talking till 7am, never gave up on the conversation, he did the same for me a while later down the road when I was having problems. People who aren't willing to talk to you and help you aren't worth keeping around. Believe me there is a friend out there who is willing to listen. I guess do keep in mind that not everyone has infinite patients and has their own problems. good luck out there man hope things go well for you. (This isn't to say you can't have acquaintances, people you hang out with, but never get deep)   \n",

I'm 26 with a decent job and live alone with no girlfriend. I tell myself that it's because I don't have a license due to a seizure disorder that I'm striking out with girls, which is probably true is some cases but I can't even see that girl being in one relationship for the rest of her life if she's picky like that.   \n",
