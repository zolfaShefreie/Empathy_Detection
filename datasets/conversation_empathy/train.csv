And I recently finished watching an anime called Orange which was mostly very good at dealing with the issue, the one caveat being that characters tend to talk about 'saving' people quite a lot, which can be a little bit galling (lol). Music-wise, Brand New have done a number of songs which either deal with depression (or emotions that can be closely linked to depression) or are pretty evocative in that sense tonally-speaking.

Worrying about them over and over does nothing to help you. *Depression thrives in rumination*. Try looking into mindfulness meditation. It's not spiritual garbage, it's literally training the neural pathways in your brain to put less weight on particular thoughts, so that you don't get stuck in negative feedback loops. It takes time to change your brain structure, but it can be done. Another thing is to find distractions.

221,3832.0,"Therapy: it works if you have a good therapist who helps you understand yourself; why you feel or don't feel certain things, ways you bring certain miseries upon yourself. Also if they are a champion for you. What I mean by that is they empathize with you rather than shoving psycho babble down your throat. They offer real tools for help. Also, you have to put in the work. Therapy doesn't fix anything. Just helps educate you on how to better handle yourself. Meds also work, but sometimes you have to try a few different kinds to find the best fit for you. They don't work overnight either; they can take upwards of 10-14 days in most cases before your brain starts to readjust.

242,3844.0,"Youa re comdemned to a life of freedom. Is an old quote i tihnk its from satre, but im not sure. And later there has been others who disagree. You are forced to become alive and aware that much is for sure. Unlike most animals you are a creature born with the abillity gather information and draw conclusion not jsut based on your senses, and that oftens leads to the question. Why am i alive?  Not only that, you are forced into not just a world, but a particular part of the word, which then in turn will teach you values and conformaty, and for some people this works out well. If you can find it in yourself to look at the context you have born into and be satisfied with it, enjoy it and love it, if you can find shelter, food, sleep, joy, love and challenge in you enviroment. But for some of us, we don't fin those things, we suddenly find ourself in a enviroment that conflicts with our nature, the context of our existence is not operationable with the essence of our nature.  You first statement i cannot, say is wrong, you didn't decide to exist, but netiher did you chose not to. And existing in of itself is not evil or good. But if the context of your life is making your life or nature feel haunted and painful. Then a there are options available. The first thing, no matter how you want to change your context for the better, rquires that you step back and see the context.  Where are you from, what values have been impsoed on you, which makes sense to you which doesn't, how has these values been imposed, who has impsoed them. For these purposes your reasoning is a great tool. It easy to finda figure head or a single person to blame, but you really have to map it out, and see udnerstand ana analyse your einvirotment and the people in it, and then find the conflicts with your nature, the pain and sadness.  Then you have to figure out a plan. And this is a tremendous task, not just do you have to think thoguhts you ahve not been taught to think, you have to be critical of a system that raised you and shaped you. You have to go against the nature of what normal is and accept yourself. And then you ahve to find out how you want to change the context of your life.  alkohol amkes me miserable, and everyone i know drinks Find people you can exist with with out alcohol  My father is violent Create an existence were you are independant from him  School is terrible translate My class mates bully me daily Find another school  thes are simple i know, and jsut examples. Now i know you asked why do i have to do all this hard work and i threw some of the most difficult work and ideas at you. But the things is all what ive jsut said is the reasonalbe arguemtn for you nature, essence and existence and a way to improve it.  when you ask why, reason is not a tool that can answer. its like trying to build a ship using lead, sure maybe it can be done, but its deffinately not the best way.  Refelection, abstract thought, contemplation, emotion, empathy. those are the tools to arrive at an answer.  If reason was used, human life wouldn't really have value. If you were the head of state and only used reason, you would quickly realize, human lives are not what drives you foward, what makes progress and creates a super power. And lives could turn into numbers. Sure educated people anda strong work force is good reasonable arguments to have a population, but only if they are educated or strong. Using reason to determine worth of life can lead to terrible ideas or no answers.  You have to work hard right now, because you are worth it depsise allt he pain you are in you are worth it, and you deserve to be your best you. And if you don't liek working 8 hours a day then sleep 8 hours and then have 8 hours for yourself. Then there are options, but because you born into this context you ahve to work hard to get to those oprions. It is hard to change your enviroment.  You have to stay alive becuase, you know a humans life has worth and you are one. When you see another in pain you wish he wouldn't ahve to be, when i see your words and want to help you but am incapable i still try.

335,3909.0,"It's a sad reality that everything comes to an end and that we're not given an exact explanation of why we're here or what the meaning of it all is. The way I see it is that we're here to give our life meaning one way or another. Since we don't know the meaning we have to make the meaning. Some people find that through their work, family, helping others, etc. Life is full of endless possibilities of what we can do with it. It's hard getting to the point where we feel like we're happy or accomplished but that in itself is another aspect of life and finding meaning. For some people it could take most of their lives to find the meaning that they were looking for and in my view I'd rather spend my whole life looking for that meaning and helping who I can along the way than to just accept that there's no meaning to it and end it since that's not really an answer. I may never get the answer myself but I can at least enjoy the journey leading to the end and maybe that in and of itself was the meaning all along. You'll meet many varieties of people throughout your life who will give you different perspectives of what meaning is to them and maybe that will help you on your journey and maybe it won't. We have the time we're given and what we do with it is dependent on us. Even after we die and join the rest of the universe in it's infinite there'll still be people around who will say, Hey remember u/OkayScience, I want to do what he did and live my life to its fullest. We can still be remembered for the life we lived even after we're gone and in that way we'll essentially live forever. This is the way I see life and it helps me from time to time. I still have my bad days and sometimes consider if it's all worth it but then I just keep going because I won't know if I just stop here. Plus it helps talking to people about it at times and if you do feel like talking about it more feel free to send me a message.

Still has been clinically depressed for years. Still making meager money. Every person I can think I'd back in college that studied fine arts or art history has rich families so they can continue to pursue a masters or phd in areas they like without worries. For those who don't have a privileged background, starving artists are no cliche - that's the norm. And I think people who are already depressed are unlikely to find poverty to be a good escape. Film - very unstable depending what you work on. Networking is extremely important and you must be socially savvy because it's all about power and money, even in independent films. This means competition and getting funding will be incredibly difficult. Therapists - you need good education and superb social skills and emotional control. A depressed person is unlikely to have the latter. All require years of training. Nurses - I don't need to elaborate more. Just google how many perfectly healthy, capable, and motivated nurses who still got burnt out and depressed. It's long work hours, high pressure and physically demanding to boot.

Don't drink any more for now, maybe try and get some sleep or have a nice bath or shower or watch tv or something so you can calm down.  Please see a professional- a doctor or a therapist or something. Self harm is very serious. I have been doing it for many years, and it is a difficult addiction to break out of. If you feel the urge to cut again, take a deep breath, count to 10. Write your feelings down or draw them out, even if you don't think you're a great artist or whatever. It will help to get the emotions out. Do you have a good friend you can talk to about it? Or a pet or even a stuffed toy? Talking helps. I'm sorry you're feeling this way.

640,421.0,Laziness or lack of motivation.. How have some of you battled depression related laziness?,1,0,421
641,4108.0,"Hi Talk2muchaa,  Lik onus111 suggested, 'feeling like doing something' just does not happen. If you're deeply unhappy with a lack of activity in your life, you just need to force yourself to do it - That's the sad reality of it. HOWEVER, that doesn't mean that there aren't ways to make FORCING yourself 'easier' on your mind and less stressful. If you want to build a house consisting of a 1000 bricks, take 30 seconds a day to lay 3 bricks and in one year, you will have a house.  You can't punish yourself for not building Rome in a day. You will go on Twitch and see streamers who are making millions... YouTubers who are making millions. I mean fuck, PewDiePie has 56 million subscribers.  But that shit didn't happen in just one day. You need to break shit up into increments. Perhaps others don't have to do this. But it's the only way I've found to get anything done. If you want to learn a language, go on Duolingo. Set a '10 points per day' challenge. Yes, it's jack-shit in terms of work. It takes literally 2 minutes a day, BUT- it's something.  Try and ignore your brain saying Increase the goal to 50 a day, we're getting fuck-all done because this will break your discipline and you'll go back to 0 a day.  Consistently doing 10 a day for 11 days, is better than doing 50 a day for 2 days, burning out and stopping altogether. The key to beating depression-induced laziness is TINY, incremental steps. For example, I'm learning Calculus on Khan Academy. One. Lesson. A Day.  That's right- the average Khan video is around 10 minutes. I do one video a day. I am slowly, but consistently learning. Each day I go over the notes from the previous day. The problem isn't volume- it's consistency.",2,0,421

These letters arent really something I can handwrite in a timely manner without having the courage to keep writing.  Do the police access the computer and shift through the belongings to find the letters or wouls I have to send them out myself to have them delivered? What happens to my belongings? If I lock myself in a nonshared dorm room and kill myself, how long would it take to find my body and who would be responsible for cleaning it up? Would it leave my family in debt? Would blowing my head off or hanging myself leave my body in a state where it's unusable for a funeral?  I'm turning 20 in 2 months and I'm just too tired. Id like to finally be able to rest and not have to live a conitant life of fear and sadness.

Your mom and sibling would spend the rest of their lives wondering if it was something they did or said that pushed you over the edge, or thinking about what they could have done differently to be there for you. One of both of them would likely spiral into a depression of their own. I used to think that no one would miss me much if I killed myself, but always remember the sound of my brothers voice when he found me with blood pouring from my arm. That something that you can just get over. Even leaving notes really help the pain for your family. Also consider the suffering of the people who found you. It could be an RA or a dorm mate. They would be traumatized for life, with severe PTSD from seeing a dead, decomposing body. That point would be too late for you to do anything, so we try not to let it go that far. get me wrong, I know where coming from, and not trying to make you feel bad for would be wrong. And clear from the fact that even thinking about these things that you have some reservations, so build on that. Take every little good thing that happens to you and imagine never feeling that way again, and imagine robbing the people you love of those feelings as well. Forgive me for being brash, but there is absolutely nothing delicate or glorious about suicide. The people who experience it secondhand go through ten times the suffering of the people who commit it.

There is always a reason, why some things happen. The reason is, to teach you a lesson.  For example: if you have no friends (like me), see it as negative. Try to find the lesson behind this experience. In this case, life wants to tell you, that loneliness is not what you, in your deepest self, want. You need persons such as friends around you. Take a desicion now, that you want to be lonely anymore, and life will listen to you and bring you friends again, and if it work, try to know, why it (i know the answer, but a bit complicated (msg me if you want to know)) and what the lesson in this experience is.  Also: Life is like a mirror. If you feel lonely inside, the outside world will deliver you that loneliness. pretty simple. So if you want to be lonely anymore, try not to feel lonely (i know fking hard, but you can reach that with more knowledge about the truth (msg me if you want to know more).

As for finding one at that age most people I know went into food or retail. Coffee shops, fast food, some with cars did pizza delivery. Theaters usually higher younger people. They're simple jobs that don't require a lot of training and younger employees help keep younger crowds coming in. There should be someone at your school like a counselor with info on work permits.

Plus having the experience will help get better jobs. Just remember you don't have to save everything.

If anyone needs me feel free to message me. If you suspect you have depression or have Suicidal thoughts or actions. Talk to your doctor. My therapist tells me to make plans to hold myself accountable to go out. I won't tell you you need a god or give you advice. I'm content with loving you and grieving with you if you need that.

1421,4592.0,"That has to be tough.  It's different strokes for different folks of course but I might have a suggestion. I find my depression tends to be racing negative thoughts. My understanding is that there are two default brain modes, one is random thought, day dreaming for example, and the other is processing. So you need to switch from day dreaming to processing, and that is hard for everyone. Start with meditation. Close your eyes for 5min and focus on your breathing. If your thoughts drift from breathing, then shut it down n snap back to breathing. Don't get emotional, just stay calm and focus on breathing. When finished, move everything that is a distraction away from you. No phone, no internet if possible, just clear that shit away and start studying as if it is your breathing. This focus is just like a muscle and the more you flex the stronger it will become. Don't expect to focus for hours on end, but try to catch yourself when you drift and get back to that focus.  Also make studying fun, or less boring. Take notes, highlight pages, repeat the things you read. Most importantly, try telling a story with what you are learning. It's a strong method for memorization. People with ordinary memories use stories and codes to memorize full decks of cards in minutes. Good luck!",2,1,905

Write a paragraph a day for 3 weeks and or write two paragraphs when you miss a day due to depression and voila! Same results, different pace, depression included and worked around. Practice self care and indulge in the fee things that make you feel okay. stay in your dorm/apartment constantly. Seriously, even if you go to the library for a few hours a day, it helps with isolation.  If you like to write, start roleplays with people on geeking or rolemance and reply when you need a break from academic writing. Otherwise indulge in low energy hobbies.

I learned how to deal with the symptoms a lot better than I did from years prior.. looking back.. thst could've gone poorly. I'd recommend being open in discussion with your psychiatrist about the effects these drugs are having on your body and your mood. There are quite a few drug combinations for this type of diagnosis, and it would be wise to work dilligently with your psychiatrist until you find the combination for you. Don't be afraid of them changing your meds. They aren't work anyway, so you may as well be open to working with professionals to find something that works for you and your body. I'd also recommend to try being aware as possible if the symptoms, the triggers for those symptoms, and look to grow from them even while on these medications. Keep a close eye out for unwanted side effects. A lot of the medicines they may try to prescribe would require regular schedules blood work. I'll be honest, I did the irresponsible thing and ended up just not taking them. I got tired of taking medicine at that point; because, I had been taking it all my life. Whether it was for childhood epilepsy, ADHD, depression, and the last diagnosis cyclothymia. Was hospitalized twice before I got the cyclothymia diagnosis, and it was pretty bad at one point, and looking back.. I'm really lucky I didn't mess myself up by just stopping cold turkey.

I want to feel happy, I just... don't. This blankness is what's really killing me, because now I can't build relationships or imagine a future. I'm destined to live alone and with no purpose.

I realize now that everyone goes through the same type of things and you can't fight them. Adults have the same issues with heartbreak and money trouble as teens, the only difference is they think they're experienced. No one is experienced. Everything that happens to you is the first time that unique situation happened to your unique person. Your reaction is the only thing that changes how these events affect you. I know it's generalizing a bit, but if only good things happen to happy people, it's because those people tend to focus on the good things that happen to them and view the bad things that happen as an obstacle that they need to overcome.

2163,5045.0,"I saw your post several hours ago and I've been thinking all afternoon about what you asked. I'm not sure if I can fully explain the shift I made from being depressed and suicidal to the generally happy person I am now. There was a whole series of decisions and lessons and realizations I've made over a period of several years which probably merits its own post (or series of them). I joined this subreddit a short time ago and have been sort of lurking, trying to understand this community and seeing if I have anything to contribute, and your post makes me realize that maybe just telling my story will help others make their own way on their journey.  To answer your specific question, the one thing I have come to understand is that there really isn't going to be a time when you are entirely done with it. There will always be a chance, however small, that you can fall back into it. However the longer you go without falling back in, the easier it gets. I tend to think of it in terms of black holes and orbital bodies. I'm going to have to create a post on that.  The truths I've found is that recovery and freedom from depression is about breaking habitual negative lines of thought by replacing it with more positive ones. It's about learning how to recognize when you are falling back into the pit of depression, and being able to pull yourself back out. It's about accepting and finding value in yourself, and finding many many reasons to continue to be alive, to contribute and interact with the rest of the world. Coming from the other side, I understand so many things that I used to see as negative really don't have any sort of positive or negative connotation. That was all in my head. Often those negative connotations were put there by others, sometimes inadvertently, sometimes deliberately. I had to learn how to strip those ideas off and choose a new set of ideas to assign. I learned how to identify what kind of ideas were worth keeping and using, and which ones were not and discard them.  I know this doesn't really explain much how I see things now, and how I no longer feel depressed all the time, but I promise to share my story in the hopes of helping you understand how I got where I am, and maybe help you make a similar journey.",2,1,1358

It's part of who you are and that is okay. I do not have severe depression so I am not on meds, so can't speak for those folks who are, but for me exercise and doing things for me (rather than constantly for others or other people's approval) really helped. It's like learning to be selfish in a good way. Eating less carbs and gluten helped too as they tended to make my body more sluggish which did t help when I already felt sad/slow/tired. I eat a lot more protein and fresh veggies now and I think there is a big difference--especially after 6+ months.

Combined with my very mild ASD I never really got to have much interaction with other kids outside of school, never even really had friends I would talk to during the day. I never learned how to be an adult when it comes to relationships (of all kinds). Because society just developed that way, I guess. Everybody is on their damn phones.

I would suggest starting with some easy job that you can find without any trouble. For instance, you can do data entry in the beginning.

3333,5770.0,"Yeah, this feeling is a strong one. Felt it consistently for a lot of my childhood and early adulthood.  The truth is that I never dealt with it constructively, or at least in a way that could help me get to the root of that feeling.  Part of the reason I think you and I are on this subreddit in the first place is because we were never taught how to deal with that feeling constructively.  In my case, I used constant denial and self-numbing ... At some point, I just assumed the pit was a part of me I could choose to ignore. You seem to be actively trying to experience it.  You are engaging your sadness, which is objectively good for working through depression. It may not be what you might call 'conventional' but everyone does their thing a little differently :)  If what you are doing no longer works for you though, it might be best to start looking for other (healthy) ways of working through that discomfort.  Personally, when I feel that pit, I know what thoughts tend to follow it. Fortunately, my therapists (and my stay at hospital) helped me come up with ways to attack that pit when it hit me hard.  In order to redirect those thoughts that create it, I try to reach out to anyone in my support net. It's hard because I feel like they won't give a shit, but most of the time, they do (but I often choose to ignore that reality).  Or I will simply write some positive words here, on this subreddit. Reaching out to others here in positive ways is not just for others, but for my own sake as well. As you put so well, giving that pit a 'purpose'.  But don't cover that feeling up.

Which was a year ago. For the first and last time since. I barely remembered their faces and not a single name. So I guess I left an impression.  I really like to banter, to do play on words and take words from their mouth and turn them around in a fun way. I joke and tell stories with expressive facial expressions and big gestures. I'm sarcastic, sometimes even cynical. And I joke a lot about myself, mostly in a non-flattering way.  I think people like me in general, I seldomly had someone outright refuse to interact with me.  But on the other hand, as soon as I come home, I feel a crushing void and I feel alone and that everything is pointless. Those feelings remain in my day-to-day life. And it starts to interfere with my work, for example. I am not one to contain my feelings in an enviroment where I spend most of my days and life in. My boss already told me once, in a pretty long phase of being really depressed, that even my collegues said that something must be seriously wrong and the have no fun working around and with me if I'm in such mood.  I can be fun at work, too. I made my co-workers laugh on a lot f different occasions. But that happens in good phases.

It also shows you who really cares, cause calling you selfish is just choosing the victim route, for themselves, which is fucked. While some may call it manipulation. Whatever the name, it's hardly sympathetic, and isnt even close to empathetic. Which, empathy, is what this world is lacking. A partnership society would support each other regardless of their stance or tradition. But, we live in a male dominated, monotheistic world. People suck. The only thing we can do is help them.

3453,5847.0,"I tend to go back to sleep over and over, and I eat at dinner time. spend the nights playing video games and then I oversleep. I need a balance of alone time and time with friends to start feeling like myself again, and if I get that balance wrong I can meltdown. I tend to downplay my problems to the people around me and upplay them to strangers. For example, inflate things for the sake of a conversation with some crisis volunteer or something, just to get some free sympathy and support that I have to feel weird about later because I see that person again. But, if a friend asks me how doing, my first reaction is to reply I have good friends so they call me out on this.  I self sabotage by missing appointments or shutting out natural light. If cold, thirsty, hungry or uncomfortable, I ignore it and let myself suffer. I know getting better when I start doing certain things for myself. If I make myself some tea or get more blankets or sit somewhere other than my bed, I tell myself because I care about myself and want to feel better. I have physical pain associated with depression, usually I feel an ache in my arms and legs. When I have the energy I stretch to alleviate it. This also helps me feel better.  I have to be conscious of whether I have the energy to do something, because if I force myself I could get overwhelmed and just sink further down. had to learn to say no to people when what they ask of me is more than I can provide without suffering later. But, for the most part, learned my depression will leave when good and ready. been going downhill for two months and had a meltdown a few nights ago so been thinking a lot about what I really need to get through these times. These depressed phases tend to last 4-6 months for me so still got a long way to go. This my first rodeo, though, prepared. learned that there are plenty of little things I can do that feel like self care. Self care is not always an elaborate bath with essential oils and red wine. To me self care is getting up to make a cup of tea, spending a couple minutes stretching, or ordering food when hungry instead of waiting until everything is closed and starving. It have to make you feel better all at once, but all those little things add up, and it means more when you put conscious value on it. will stretch so my body hurt so much, and I do this because I care about feeling I say to myself.

I begged my parents to let me come home and buy my prescriptions. I had a terrible UTI and bladder infection. Going back home was terrible and good at the same time. I was sad to be home, my parents were angry with me and told me all the terrible things they believed about me while I was gone. Things they heard from other people and things I think they imagined. About 80% were completely untrue. I was a disappointment and a sinner. I was sad to be away from my boyfriend and glad to be away from him at the same time. He was considerably older than I and of course I had envisioned our life together as different. The second time I ran away I had a better plan partly. I took my clothes and anything else I could throw in my friends car and went to her house where she lived with her grandparents. The next morning I woke up to my Step Mom standing at my feet telling me to get up and come with her and Dad. I grew up very depressed, my Mother passed away when I was 2 1/2 years old, then my older sister passed away few years later. Every day I was sad. I didn't understand what happened, I didn't understand how something so terrible could happen and life changed drastically and in a flash. No one talked to me about any of it and I was broken.

I still haven't worked things out that I'm able to effectively handle failure myself, but mainly people can feel better when they fail, because they recognise it as a learning experience, or it is an inevitable part of the process. Now this may sound obvious, but when in the moment, it is very easy to forget this and lose sight of progress after the failure. Failure can appear in many forms.  My expectation of a 'good outcome', instead was a horrible mistake... Or was it? I'm sorry to hear you feeling even worse after your suicide attempt.

If you can't rely on that, you are fucked. If you suddenly can't feel some emotions anymore, you're fucked. If you no longer feel the moral qualms that have guided you for years, you're fucked. Please tell me what is worse than only being able to use a computer to interact with your environment and that computer being broken in a way we don't understand? Just that it is worse than that, because there is no you. You are the computer and your network card is fried, your CPU has a tear and your battery no longer holds charge...and there's nothing that can be done. All you can do is grit your teeth and keep going. Try to adjust to the fact your version of reality is not actually real and that information you are getting about your body is downright not true - apart from when it is, because if your brain believes you have no energy, you sure as fuck have no energy. Try to not let the lack of love and happiness and the very concept of hope throw you into that pit of despair. Now, pray tell me, what precisely could be worse? I'd rather be hungry with a broken arm, because then I would still know that it is me who is hungry and that my arm hurts. I could still believe that may be tomorrow there will be food. I would feel the natural drive of self preservation to bandage that arm. You have no concept of what a malfunctioning brain means and I hope that you never will, but please do not compare it with other experiences, because there is nothing like it short of hypoxia at the summit of Mt.

Helps me a bit but maybe placebo effect.  5-HTP: Tried while really depressed/anxious and it didn't help. SSRIs didn't either and only a long acting Benzo did anything beneficial. Might try again later.  Valerian root: Calms some people down. Doesn't do much for me.  Rhodiola Rosea: Apparently gives you more energy while keeping you calm. Maybe a bit more energy for me but could be placebo effect.  St. John's Wart: Supposed to be a natural antidepressant. I am thinking of trying it soon.  Magnesium: Helps some people (assuming deficiency exists) but I have not tried it yet.  Alcohol: Works great to calm social anxiety in a moment! Don't consume if taking prescription drugs. Consume in moderation if you need to drive home.  Marijuana: Can really elevate mood, depends on the person. Can be combined with alcohol for added effect. Don't drive at all after using it. Don't use if illegal where you live or your employer drug tests.  ---  Lifestyle:  ---  Exercise: Some people rave that being active reduces anxiety and depression. In my case the gym is actually a trigger. I do enjoy going for a walk on a nice day though.  Diet: I have started eating better and less. I have lost substantial weight and feel physically better. The sense of accomplishment and feeling better about my body has probably helped my depression.  Travel: If you can afford it take a vacation and go see the world. Go alone so that you can discover your true self and not be at the whim of another person. It was an extremely positive experience for me.  ---",2,1,2340

Don't let a day go by where you did absolutely nothing productive. It only takes something small to qualify as more than zero.

Wearing a mask is exhausting as hell, and the longer you try to keep it up, the more explosive will it be, when you can't hold it up any longer. In that regard, I speak from experience.  And last but not least, it's completely fine to not feel happy sometimes. You just have to feel sad, out of the loop, neglected, rejected or even hated sometimes.

In my experience, the depression will come back once not high (and sometimes even worse than it was before getting high) which has the potential for psychological dependence. Within 9 months of beginning self medication I went from smoking like $10 worth 2-3 times a week to 2-3 times a day so beware. By the end of the 9 month period I was spending about $200 a week on weed.

We recently talked after a few months of NC and her getting leveled out on anti-depressants. Her hurt was not the same as mine. Her emotions were flat-lined. Anhedonia. The sadness, anger, frustration, confusion, despair that I felt are emotions she was incapable of feeling. I know this because I was severely depressed myself years ago. Even now since she is on SSRI's, and with it being months later, I don't think her hurt is even close to what mine was. I think her hurt is more in regret. I honestly doubt she will ever truly hurt over this breakup - by the time she's off the meds and capable of feeling those raw emotions again, it will probably be a total of 1-2 years since the breakup. She'll only have to deal with regret - if even that.   Of course some cynical side of me wants her to feel what I did. I want her to grieve the loss of our relationship like I did. I want her to think about what we had, let those good memories fill her with the positive emotions we had together, and have them followed up by sadness over the realization she lost it. But when I really think about it, I know I don't want that to happen. She cried enough when she started sinking lower into depression. The outbursts, the frustration, the fear of losing me.

Feeling like this, is not permanent, it's only temporary.

It is only once those moments pass that we can look back and connect the dots to see that it really wasn't such a big deal. So my advice is this: As you look forward, remember that in the past the dots have always connected correctly, and have faith that those dots will connect the way they need to again. People often ask me why I don't worry about these seemingly huge problems in my life. Well, it's not that I don't worry, because I do. That's just being human, but I constantly remind myself that things usually just work out, and I just need to run the course that I see in front of me. So follow the course, stay on track, and when little problems feel like mountains in front of you, have faith that the dots will connect, and you will come out the other side as a stronger person.

More negative mental health the worse and more frequent the seizure like symptoms happen. Also have bad tremors and ticks in relation to the non epileptic seizures. I often fall down and have issues walking and standing. Can barely leave my home. Am reduces to limit movement inside my home which has caused weight gain from decrease movements which also stregnthens my depression which in return causes more seizure like episodes. No medication helps my mental or physical health. It actually worsens both. I am going without treatment because doctors refuse to take it seriously or are completely dumbfounded.

Because without it, we will be too dependent on others and that becomes burdensome because no one's life is perfect and they all have their own issues to deal with. Even though other people wants to love you and support you, they can only do it to a certain extent. The rest of the void that you have inside of you can only be filled by yourself. I know you don't feel it but being able to learn to self love is the key to happiness because that is when you feel like your life is in your control again, not on others.

4445,6446.0,"it *probably* depends on the state (edit: what state in the US). being 14, you are going to be tethered to your parent/guardian legally. the therapist/counselor/psychologist will be legally required to tell your guardians of anything that serves of specific risk. for example, i told my therapist that i was suicidal and he had to contact my mother and explain the basics of the situation. for self harm, im not sure exactly how/if the information would be disclosed by the therapist/counselor/psychologist to your parents.. but im assuming if you are physically hurting yourself to a GREAT EXTENT then yes, it would most likely be disclosed.  im 18 now, and started seeing my on-campus(university) therapist and psychiatrist at the beginning of the school year, where i was 17. it sucks not being in control of your life, but what can you do, you know?  if getting to see a therapist is an issue, i would recommend asking to talk to your doctor/pediatrician in private (during a normal check-up) and say tht youve had symptoms of depression/anxiety and you'd like to have some help talking to your parent about getting help. if it's not an issue of talking to your parent/guardian, then what's the worry? if you cant see a doctor, a school counselor could help you have this conversation with your parent! or even a supportive teacher that you trust.  i went through a very similar situation when i was younger, and very much regret not being more persistent about getting help when i needed it. it mght not go away, and with school only getting harder and more stressful as you age, it's *really hard* to deal with all this emotional baggage. everyone deserves to feel the best that they can.  you dont want to suffer anymore and someday you wont! feel free to pm me, i'd be happy to be your pen-pal through all this &lt;3",2,1,2759

Boiling water shouldn't be used as it will scald and is just as prone to infection and other nasties as cutting, so just try clenching a fist under the regular hot water for a few seconds.

Now I'm equally depressed in uni when I should be having even more fun partying and learning new things. What am I waiting for? Being even more depressed in an office job? It's too much..,1,0,2914
4699,6601.0,"That whole best years of your life thing, at least in my opinion, is a load of hogwash. Best years? Body going through changes? Trying to figure out your first relationships? Stuck in school all day? Drama everywhere? Restricted in everything you want to do? Inexperienced enough to not know what you really want to do? I could go on... HS sucks. With very few exceptions, the only people I know who consider HS the best years are people who are completely and totally miserable adults who are looking back with rose-colored glasses at a time when their parents paid for everything. College is better for most people, but the partying and crap is highly overrated once you're old enough to look back a bit. I don't know anyone who misses that stuff. But what are the best years? I think once you hit your mid-20s things really start to look up. Odds are, your career is at least starting to actually materialize, you aren't as emotionally immature anymore and things don't bother you like they used to, and generally speaking the odds are that things are more stable overall.  Don't sell your future short--you'll look back and realize there's a lot of crap in HS/college that you'll be glad to have behind you!!",2,0,2914

4705,6604.0,"To answer your question, I'm actually feeling alright today. Had an existential crisis last night and probably would have ended up killing myself or at the very least cutting myself if it wasn't for my dog licking my hand as I layed in bed crying myself to sleep (she's NEVER an affectionate dog, it took me a minute to even realise that she was actually licking my hand and I wasn't imagining shit). Thanks, Charlie.  Anyways, for me depression is like absolute insanity. It's not just sadness or feeling like killing myself every other week. Just pure insanity. The best example I can give is probably two years ago, seventh grade. That was probably the lowest I had ever been. Every night when I went to sleep, I'd stay up on my phone. Not because I wanted to be, because it kept me from going to sleep and having the same nightmares I had every night. And then I'd look at the time, which by now was probably about 12 AM, realise how absolutely sad and pathetic I was and turn on some emo music, usually being something like Set it Off's I'll Sleep When I'm Dead and listen to that as I (literally) sadistically laugh and cry myself to sleep. Some nights, that kind of stuff never happened. I'd have a peaceful sleep. Some nights I'd stay up all night debating whether I should text the suicide hotline, doing so, and it being no help whatsoever.  So I'd get, maybe six hours of sleep at most. Before I'm woken up and have to get ready for school. How am I woken up? By my parents during the best part of my dream or the most peaceful part of my nightmare. Which already started my day off terribly. Then for an hour I'd be in the bathroom once again listening to emo music as I let the shower water run. My favourite songs to listen to were usually just about anything by Hollywood Undead. Not something a twelve year old should be listening to, sure. But it was a way to cope with my depression. As I listen to those songs, once again sadistically laughing at my own pain and often times end up cutting myself. I never cut myself deep, I was far to afraid of doing that. But... I enjoyed seeing the blood come out. I didn't cut for any sort of high or release of pain. It was sort of hard to explain. I was never addicted to cutting, I could stop or start whenever I wanted. Sometimes stopping for months at a time, but seeing the blood, made me feel happy. If you could have seen my eyes, especially when I cut myself, you wouldn't have seen any traces of a twelve year old. You'd see an insane person desperately trying to grasp on to the last straw of sanity, but nothing else. Some days I'd debate whether I should do a sort of murder-suicide thing. Or at the very least murder those who have caused me pain and suffering. Sometimes I'd have very and scarily elaborate plans on how I'd trick, kidnap, or kill my family. Things that you'd never expect from a twelve year old. But quite frankly, I might have physically been twelve, but my depression had probably aged and matured me way faster. The ride to school was probably the most traumatic for me. The ride was only about ten minutes (five minutes to school, five minutes in the carpool line). But those ten minutes were full of tests streaming down my face, me punching myself or ripping my hair out, or destroying my notebooks or pencils. Sometimes because I just really didn't want to go to school. Sometimes because my social anxiety got the best of me. Sometimes for reasons I don't even know. Me and my grandma would usually sit at the front of the school for about an hour or two, I'm sitting there trying to find a way to hurt myself because I'm angry, but don't want to let my anger out on her, and she's crying because she's absolutely lost on how to help me. I'd usually end up getting to school about a good three hours late.  In school, I don't remember anything. Maybe it's because I was just walking around the school like a robot. Class for an hour, find your next class, repeat. In class, I'd have my head down in a book (not paying attention to the teacher whatsoever), I'd be mindlessly reciting the emo songs I listen to in my head, or I'd be talking to my friend AIDEN. (Yes, his name is in all caps). What I do definitely remember is hating all of my peers. Hell, I still hate them. It's not my hatred for them itself. It's just I can't stand how immature, idiotic, and stupid they were. Like who the hell goes around sticking Tide pods in their mouths for views on social media? Or who thinks it's funny to go around telling people to kill themselves because you heard your favourite edgy YouTuber say it and now you think it's hilarious to do so. Or why do you think it's cool and okay to curse every five seconds and use the N-word? Or why do you think that because you saw Kim Kardashian half naked in some photo shoot that you can show up to school with hardly any clothes on or sag and talk about fucking whores because your favourite rapper said it in their newest song? Act your own god damn age, quit trying to act like someone three times your age while being as immature as a kindergartener.  More on AIDEN: AIDEN sort of just appeared out of nowhere. I don't know when or why I came up with him, I just sort of did. I'm not schizophrenic, he was 100% my own voice talking back to me in my head, but I enjoyed pretending to have someone to talk to. Someone who walked around with me everyday, knew exactly what I was thinking, and could relate to me all the time. Someone who (though was just my own voice), talked me out of suicide many times back in 7th grade. But slowly I started treating AIDEN a lot more like a real person. To the point where I could have easily been mistaken as someone with schizophrenia.  At home I'd just go into my room and basically lock myself in. My door was never locked, my parents could come in and out as they pleased, but I would just hand out under the covers all day. I didn't want to see light, light didn't want to see me. I didn't bother with homework. I figured, I fail, I fail. I really had just given up with life at that point. The only reason why I hadn't killed myself was probably because I was too sad and lazy to bother trying. Occasionally I'd talk to AIDEN or watch YouTube or something, but most times I ended up listening to hypnosis. Hypnosis for me was like a way to escape real life. Like meditation, but instead of being left alone with my sad and depressing thoughts, I could listen to someone else. At first it was a nice little escape, but then it more or less because an addiction. An odd strange one that I'd never be able to explain to anyone, but an addiction none the less. I'd try to listen to hypnosis any time I could even if that meant going into my room away from family to listen to it. It kind of gave me the same high that cutting, smoking, drugs, or porn give other people. Even though it was just hypnosis, it really did become unhealthy. Before I knew it, it was time for me to go to bed. And then the whole cycle would repeat itself over and over and over and over and over again. It was the same routine, same schedule, same insanity over and over again. This sounds like more is going on than just depression, right? Like some other underlying mental illness. But this is all depression and a bit of social anxiety. No MPD, no schizophrenia, no bipolar disorder, I'm not a psychopath or sociopath. This was all thanks to my depression.  No one actually knew how bad my mental state was. I never told anyone. I was diagnosed with depression and put on meds, but if anyone really knew how bad it was, I likely truly would have been put in a mental health hospital. This is where the most insane part was, since being on my meds, I'm a lot more stable. But I miss being the way I was. Even though they were supposed to, my meds didn't help my depression. It really just made me more stable. Now without AIDEN or cutting myself or the enjoyment of listening to emo music as I sadistically laugh and cry at the same time, I just feel empty. Though I was completely fucked up, it was still fun a times to laugh at how much I hate myself and my life. Now I can't do those things anymore. It's like being insane was a big part of me and my depression. The insanity itself was taken away, but the depression was still left. Now there's just a big, empty, dark hole.",2,1,2917

Then all of a sudden one day, I noticed that bad grades in high school aren't the end of the world. It might have been because I moved out of my Dad's place and I didn't have to hear him call me a failure anymore. Either way, I became happy again.  Then I met her. A nice girl who was my age. She had a pretty face, we had a ton of classes together, and she thought I was really funny. I was able to open up to her. I think (I know) I fell in love with her. She had a boyfriend though. He's a shitty person. He's high all the time and he always flirts around with other girls.  I really thought she would break it off with him and find her way to my arms and I'd be the happiest guy in the world. That didn't happen. I became desperate.

4750,6632.0,"I'm game and need to vent so here goes...  I was verbally, physically and emotionally abused for as long as I can recall. Since you asked about emotional abuse I will focus solely on that.  I was blamed constantly for everything that was wrong with the family. My mother told me this numerous times after she and my father would have huge, physically violent fights that started over events that had nothing to do with me.  I was constantly told If you had a brain you would be dangerous. by my mother. Not after I'd done anything, not after a stupid act or action on my part but just in passing. This was my mother's assesment of me and she told me this frequently.  I was tested, determined to have a high IQ, placed in gifted and talented classes and made to suffer for it by narcissistic, superficial, egotistical mother for my entire life. If I vot an A I was told it was because the work was too easy for me, if I got a B it was because I was lazy and never applied myself. I would constantly be accused of thinking I was So smart.  Nothing I ever did or attempted to do was good enough, there was always some flaw in it. I only received criticism, never any praise.  In 4th grade I had lovely long hair, my mother decided I should have it all cut off. She took me to a beauty school and had them cut all of my hair off, a boy cut, they shaved the back of my neck. My mom cried afterward and said she was crying because The haircut showed how ugly I was. The next week we were going into our small town to pick up this giant fancy framed picture for our living room, My mom made me walk on the opposite side of the street after we got out of the car. She said, I don't want to be seen with you and have people know you are my daughter. My mother really values externak beauty. I was a skinny unremarlable child, I never forgot the other side of the street incident, I had to look at the damn framed picture that we picked up that day until I moved away from home and got married at age 19. Every time I saw it I thought of that day. Years of torture.  I was a divorced single mother, my ex never paid a dime, not any of the support we were supposed to receive. I worked two jobs to support us. I never received any financial help from anyone. I crafted a nice career for myself and tried to be a good mom and a good person. I never drank, never did drugs or ran around or went wild or got in any trouble. But my mother was/is ashamed of me and made/makes sure to let me know it. Anyone she talks about to me she lets me know how successful their children are, how wealthy they are and how proud the parents are.  My mom told me one day how disappointed she was with how I'd turned out, how she always thought I'd be someone when I grew up. She said she'd hoped I would've grown up to marry a doctor or lawyer or someone important.  I told her I was someone. At the time I was an online database adminstrator with a nationally recognized nonprofit but to my mother I was an embarrassment, a nothing and a nobody.  My mother's father, my grandfather was one of the only people in my life that was always kind to me, he treated me like I was special and had value. My mother knew I adored him and she hated that he liked me. After he died she insisted on telling me horrible things about him saying she wanted me to know what kind of man the grandfather I worshipped really was and that I should not feel special that some thing like him tolerated me better than most.  Right after I was divorced, I was not yet employed full time and very poor. I was visifing my parents at their huge house in the country. My mother started bitching about how poor I was, I had not asked her or dad for a dime and I was not there to eat. Mom started talking about dying, asked me if I had a sill, etc.. Mom told me I better not die because she did not want to have to spend her money on a funeral for me, and she said not that anyone would show up at a funeral for me anyway. She also told me that she'd always thought of me as a living abortion, since my birth. She was going nuts, yelling and spitting. She told me she bet I was so poor, such a failure that I probably could not even afford feminine products. I got my purse to leave, opened it and hurled a few tampons at her, as I told her, wrong bitch. My father blocked the front door, and tried to make me apologise to my mother. I had to threaten to call the police before he would let me go.  After my father passed away my mother called, she said she needed to ask me something. Then mom said, Did you ever think or get the feeling that your father really loved you or cared about you? I told my mom that yes, yes I did. That dad was a fifties guy and although he may not have ever been emotionally demonstrative I thought he did love and care about me. He has worked hard and made personal sacrifices to care for us financially when I was young. That there had been a few occassions that he'd been very nice to me. Like going into a shop and buying me a top he knew I wanted for my 16th Birthday. Buying me a computer, working with me on computer projects early on, buying us both laptops, teaching me to shoot and fish, and by his having special nicknames and greetings for me, etc.. I told mom that was how dad expressed his love. My mother said, That's interesting because I always had the impression that he didn't care about you at all.  I was also emotionally abused by my father, it was different than my mother's abuse though. My dad alwsys had to be the best. He could not stand for me to be good at anything I could never, ever be as good as he was or (god fobid it) better. My parents were never involved in our education. They basically just asked us at dinner how school was and we'd say OK and dinner would proceed.  I should have known from past events not to dare say anything positive had happened but one day I was happy and excited about something that had happened at school, in English class. I was so excited that I stupidly spoke up at dinner. When the standard, How was school? question was asked I boldly said, School was great, Mrs. G, my English teacher pulled me aside after class. She told me a poem I'd written for an assignment was so good they want my permission to publish it on the first page of the student yearbook! My father put his fork down, he tilted his head, gave me a bizarre look and told me to recite the poem. I could not recite it, I was too nervous and afraid. I said I would show it to him after dinner, it was no big deal. No, dad wanted to hear this fabulous poem I had written, right then. I went and got the poem and started to read it out loud. Dad told me to give it to him to read. He told me if it was in the yearbook people woukd be reading it for themselves. Dad read it silently and then while scoffing and half laughing he read it aloud.  Dad asked me if the idiots at my school really thought that was good writing? He said he bet he could write something right then that would be a hundred times better. Dad left the table and went to his desk while we all sat at the table waiting for his return. After about twenty minutes Dad cheerfully returned, poem in hand. He stood and read it to us. It was some lame poem with Brother can you spare me a dime as one of the lines. Dad then told us, See, that's a poem, that's what good poetry is like! After that he asked all of us, Wasn't my poem better, a lot better? We all agreed, and lied and said his poem was a lot better.  I told the English teacher not to let them use my poem for the yearbook. I never wrote another poem or much else for that matter. That crap happened in 1975 and I am still not over it despite counseling.  Another thing that was a form of emotional abuse was the family hierarchy. My father came first, then my sister or mother, then me. I.always came last, even though I was the eldest child. There was this thing with the food. If we had any serving size type of meat it came into play. Let's say it is steaks for dinner, they are on a platter. The largest steak is for Dad, younger sister gets the next largest, mom third largest and smallest was for me.  It was like that with all of the food. It was an unwritten rule. I decided to challenge it once when the platter of Hamburgers was beside me. I knew better than to go for the one for Dad but tried to take the secind largest one. My mom was immediately shrieking at me, No, no, put that back, it's for your sister! Yours is the small one.  My parents home has our family pictures hanging in the study, they are hung vertically on one wall. The order is from top to bottom, a picture of my dad, a picture of my mom, a picture of my sister, a picture of my son, then a picture of me. I.am at the very bottom, like always.  I.endured physical, emotional and mental abuse. I've seen therapist on occasion over the years and at one point was in therapy sessions twice a week for a year. It helped but it hasn't enabled me forget. I just have to deal with what happened and move forward. I'm not social, I don't really trust anyone or have any close friends but I'm okay with that.

My boyfriend said this to me more frequently in the past and after YEARS of explaining why this is not a good response, he's slowly using it less, but when it pops up, my typical counter is That does not help me/make me feel better at all, and that typically shuts him up or at least makes him think about what he just said.

I see depression (speaking only for myself here) as a product of thoughts and meanings. The same thing can happen to two people, and a depressed person will give it an incredibly dark meaning, whereas a non depressed person might give it a neutral or positive one. To me, growth out of depression is when you are finally grasping the arbitrary nature of meaning, and the impersonal nature of thought, and can start to make conscious rather than automatic decisions about what kind of meanings and thoughts you feed and go with (even arbitrarily). So, I arbitrarily decide to look at failing as good, because it gives me good reference experiences, rather than as evidence that i am worthless. Things like that. I still struggle a lot, but there is overwhelming evidence that you can slowly climb out of the hole with very hard inner work, and that the things that would have previously sent you down the spiral become more like non issues.

In a period or prolonged period of despair, I don't believe there can be happiness at all, and it's only after that period has been solved, over, attacked enough by effort and time, that you can start experiencing happiness. I don't think happiness and gratitude should be forced, or you should try to feel happy when you truly cannot feel happy. I'm still going through that period, and there might be rivets or jewels of happiness along the way, but they are fleeting and leave very quickly.  The whole reason why people despair is because they are tied so strongly to negative emotional memories that they outweigh any trivial positive emotional memories. Think about it, which memories are the quickest, strongest, and most easily able to be remembered for you? The most emotional ones.  If your most emotional memories are negative, you will be in despair. On the converse, if one's most emotional memories are positive, you will be in a state of happiness.  There is a way to end your despair, you just have to face it head on and let go of everything, and keep trying to let go and accept.

4922,6743.0,"Youa re comdemned to a life of freedom. Is an old quote i tihnk its from satre, but im not sure. And later there has been others who disagree. You are forced to become alive and aware that much is for sure. Unlike most animals you are a creature born with the abillity gather information and draw conclusion not jsut based on your senses, and that oftens leads to the question. Why am i alive? Not only that, you are forced into not just a world, but a particular part of the word, which then in turn will teach you values and conformaty, and for some people this works out well. If you can find it in yourself to look at the context you have born into and be satisfied with it, enjoy it and love it, if you can find shelter, food, sleep, joy, love and challenge in you enviroment. But for some of us, we don't fin those things, we suddenly find ourself in a enviroment that conflicts with our nature, the context of our existence is not operationable with the essence of our nature. You first statement i cannot, say is wrong, you didn't decide to exist, but netiher did you chose not to. And existing in of itself is not evil or good. But if the context of your life is making your life or nature feel haunted and painful. Then a there are options available. The first thing, no matter how you want to change your context for the better, rquires that you step back and see the context. Where are you from, what values have been impsoed on you, which makes sense to you which doesn't, how has these values been imposed, who has impsoed them. For these purposes your reasoning is a great tool. It easy to finda figure head or a single person to blame, but you really have to map it out, and see udnerstand ana analyse your einvirotment and the people in it, and then find the conflicts with your nature, the pain and sadness. Then you have to figure out a plan. And this is a tremendous task, not just do you have to think thoguhts you ahve not been taught to think, you have to be critical of a system that raised you and shaped you. You have to go against the nature of what normal is and accept yourself. And then you ahve to find out how you want to change the context of your life. alkohol amkes me miserable, and everyone i know drinks Find people you can exist with with out alcohol My father is violent Create an existence were you are independant from him School is terrible translate My class mates bully me daily Find another school thes are simple i know, and jsut examples. Now i know you asked why do i have to do all this hard work and i threw some of the most difficult work and ideas at you. But the things is all what ive jsut said is the reasonalbe arguemtn for you nature, essence and existence and a way to improve it. when you ask why, reason is not a tool that can answer. its like trying to build a ship using lead, sure maybe it can be done, but its deffinately not the best way. Refelection, abstract thought, contemplation, emotion, empathy. those are the tools to arrive at an answer. If reason was used, human life wouldn't really have value. If you were the head of state and only used reason, you would quickly realize, human lives are not what drives you foward, what makes progress and creates a super power. And lives could turn into numbers. Sure educated people anda strong work force is good reasonable arguments to have a population, but only if they are educated or strong. Using reason to determine worth of life can lead to terrible ideas or no answers. You have to work hard right now, because you are worth it depsise allt he pain you are in you are worth it, and you deserve to be your best you. And if you don't liek working 8 hours a day then sleep 8 hours and then have 8 hours for yourself. Then there are options, but because you born into this context you ahve to work hard to get to those oprions. It is hard to change your enviroment. You have to stay alive becuase, you know a humans life has worth and you are one. When you see another in pain you wish he wouldn't ahve to be, when i see your words and want to help you but am incapable i still try.

5005,6797.0,"Ok, how deeply did you cut yourself and with what? If it is bleeding a lot, clean it up, run it under water, don't let the blood dry and go nasty. Pat it dry. Bandage it up, if you can. Also if you have some antiseptic cream, use some of that on it. Don't drink any more for now, maybe try and get some sleep or have a nice bath or shower or watch tv or something so you can calm down. Please see a professional- a doctor or a therapist or something. Self harm is very serious. I have been doing it for many years, and it is a difficult addiction to break out of. If you feel the urge to cut again, take a deep breath, count to 10. Write your feelings down or draw them out, even if you don't think you're a great artist or whatever. It will help to get the emotions out. Do you have a good friend you can talk to about it? Or a pet or even a stuffed toy? Talking helps. I'm sorry you're feeling this way.

5008,3112.0,Laziness or lack of motivation.. How have some of you battled depression related laziness?,1,0,3444
5009,6799.0,"Hi Talk2muchaa, Lik onus111 suggested, 'feeling like doing something' just does not happen. If you're deeply unhappy with a lack of activity in your life, you just need to force yourself to do it - That's the sad reality of it. HOWEVER, that doesn't mean that there aren't ways to make FORCING yourself 'easier' on your mind and less stressful. If you want to build a house consisting of a 1000 bricks, take 30 seconds a day to lay 3 bricks and in one year, you will have a house. You can't punish yourself for not building Rome in a day. You will go on Twitch and see streamers who are making millions... YouTubers who are making millions. I mean fuck, PewDiePie has 56 million subscribers. But that shit didn't happen in just one day. You need to break shit up into increments. Perhaps others don't have to do this. But it's the only way I've found to get anything done. If you want to learn a language, go on Duolingo. Set a '10 points per day' challenge. Yes, it's jack-shit in terms of work. It takes literally 2 minutes a day, BUT- it's something. Try and ignore your brain saying Increase the goal to 50 a day, we're getting fuck-all done because this will break your discipline and you'll go back to 0 a day. Consistently doing 10 a day for 11 days, is better than doing 50 a day for 2 days, burning out and stopping altogether. The key to beating depression-induced laziness is TINY, incremental steps. For example, I'm learning Calculus on Khan Academy. One. Lesson. A Day. That's right- the average Khan video is around 10 minutes. I do one video a day. I am slowly, but consistently learning. Each day I go over the notes from the previous day. The problem isn't volume- it's consistency.",2,0,3444

These letters arent really something I can handwrite in a timely manner without having the courage to keep writing. Do the police access the computer and shift through the belongings to find the letters or wouls I have to send them out myself to have them delivered? What happens to my belongings? If I lock myself in a nonshared dorm room and kill myself, how long would it take to find my body and who would be responsible for cleaning it up? Would it leave my family in debt? Would blowing my head off or hanging myself leave my body in a state where it's unusable for a funeral? I'm turning 20 in 2 months and I'm just too tired. Id like to finally be able to rest and not have to live a conitant life of fear and sadness. As much as I do not want to keep living this kind of life, I am too tired to keep pushing through any longer and I'd just like for my death to be somewhat feasible for my mom and sibling.",1,1,3451
5015,6802.0,"the thing, though, your death be feasible. Your mom and sibling would spend the rest of their lives wondering if it was something they did or said that pushed you over the edge, or thinking about what they could have done differently to be there for you. One of both of them would likely spiral into a depression of their own. I used to think that no one would miss me much if I killed myself, but always remember the sound of my brothers voice when he found me with blood pouring from my arm. That something that you can just get over. Even leaving notes really help the pain for your family. Also consider the suffering of the people who found you. It could be an RA or a dorm mate. They would be traumatized for life, with severe PTSD from seeing a dead, decomposing body. That point would be too late for you to do anything, so we try not to let it go that far. get me wrong, I know where coming from, and not trying to make you feel bad for would be wrong. And clear from the fact that even thinking about these things that you have some reservations, so build on that. Take every little good thing that happens to you and imagine never feeling that way again, and imagine robbing the people you love of those feelings as well. Forgive me for being brash, but there is absolutely nothing delicate or glorious about suicide. The people who experience it secondhand go through ten times the suffering of the people who commit it. Please, for the sake of a stranger on the internet who cares about you, think again. There is hope out there, even if everything seems hopeless right now.",2,1,3451

I wasn't raised the best; one thing is that I was never taught to bathe regularly. It was normal to bathe once every 2-4 weeks growing up.

So during these periods I would go as long as I could possibly can without showering until it was literally affecting everything I did, usually 4-6 weeks. My dirtiness would get into my eyes, and they would burn like hell. I got more skin problems from the build up of dead skin: in grown hairs, dry scaly skin, acne, etc. My hair had issues too: unhealthy and wiry possibly from an unhealthy scalp and follicles and dandruff. My dick had some infection and itched like hell. I also looked like shit too and was never prepared for events that forced me to go outside which made everything worse (I would hide and wait out people who potentially could see or interact with me, for example).

There is always a reason, why some things happen. The reason is, to teach you a lesson. For example: if you have no friends (like me), see it as negative. Try to find the lesson behind this experience. In this case, life wants to tell you, that loneliness is not what you, in your deepest self, want. You need persons such as friends around you. Take a desicion now, that you want to be lonely anymore, and life will listen to you and bring you friends again, and if it work, try to know, why it (i know the answer, but a bit complicated (msg me if you want to know)) and what the lesson in this experience is. Also: Life is like a mirror. If you feel lonely inside, the outside world will deliver you that loneliness. pretty simple. So if you want to be lonely anymore, try not to feel lonely (i know fking hard, but you can reach that with more knowledge about the truth (msg me if you want to know more).

They're simple jobs that don't require a lot of training and younger employees help keep younger crowds coming in. There should be someone at your school like a counselor with info on work permits.

Plus having the experience will help get better jobs. Just remember you don't have to save everything. If all you do is work and your money goes right back out to food/bills/rent/etc, work will become a burden. Put aside a little bit each paycheck as a whatever fund.

This may seem like useless advice, but it can greatly help if you tell the other people exactly how you're feeling and ask them to try and help you. Nobody will ever be inside your head and able to experience exactly what you are feeling, but by talking to them and letting them know, you can help them to understand you. Sometimes we have to do the hardest part of reaching out ourselves. I had to tell my best friend I was feeling suicidal, but by telling her she helped me turn my life around. She just didn't realise. It's never easy to do, but I can promise you that you are so much stronger than you know, and there are always people willing to listen and to try to understand what you're going through. Lastly, I hope you don't die. Not until you've been able to live the life that you want, the life that you deserve to have. I'm sending you love and luck.",2,1,3917

5181,6898.0,"That has to be tough. It's different strokes for different folks of course but I might have a suggestion. I find my depression tends to be racing negative thoughts. My understanding is that there are two default brain modes, one is random thought, day dreaming for example, and the other is processing. So you need to switch from day dreaming to processing, and that is hard for everyone. Start with meditation. Close your eyes for 5min and focus on your breathing. If your thoughts drift from breathing, then shut it down n snap back to breathing. Don't get emotional, just stay calm and focus on breathing. When finished, move everything that is a distraction away from you. No phone, no internet if possible, just clear that shit away and start studying as if it is your breathing. This focus is just like a muscle and the more you flex the stronger it will become. Don't expect to focus for hours on end, but try to catch yourself when you drift and get back to that focus. Also make studying fun, or less boring. Take notes, highlight pages, repeat the things you read. Most importantly, try telling a story with what you are learning. It's a strong method for memorization. People with ordinary memories use stories and codes to memorize full decks of cards in minutes. Good luck!",2,0,3925

5274,6953.0,"Yep. In conversations with my therapist, we have discussed me having some kind of attachment disorder around this. I am constantly seeking and craving connection with others.

Then when and if I do connect, my expectations are pretty high since I am willing to do whatever to reach out to the other person and increase the connection. When that is not reciprocated to the expectations that I have (because they are not trying to fill the massive hole that I am), I feel rejected and then shut down. I internalize this sense as a rejection of me as a person (they don't like me, I'm not worth liking, they got to know and discovered i'm no good). Rinse. Repeat. That's my pattern at least.

5319,6978.0,"I saw your post several hours ago and I've been thinking all afternoon about what you asked. I'm not sure if I can fully explain the shift I made from being depressed and suicidal to the generally happy person I am now. There was a whole series of decisions and lessons and realizations I've made over a period of several years which probably merits its own post (or series of them). I joined this a short time ago and have been sort of lurking, trying to understand this community and seeing if I have anything to contribute, and your post makes me realize that maybe just telling my story will help others make their own way on their journey. To answer your specific question, the one thing I have come to understand is that there really isn't going to be a time when you are entirely done with it. There will always be a chance, however small, that you can fall back into it. However the longer you go without falling back in, the easier it gets. I tend to think of it in terms of black holes and orbital bodies. I'm going to have to create a post on that. The truths I've found is that recovery and freedom from depression is about breaking habitual negative lines of thought by replacing it with more positive ones. It's about learning how to recognize when you are falling back into the pit of depression, and being able to pull yourself back out. It's about accepting and finding value in yourself, and finding many many reasons to continue to be alive, to contribute and interact with the rest of the world. Coming from the other side, I understand so many things that I used to see as negative really don't have any sort of positive or negative connotation. That was all in my head. Often those negative connotations were put there by others, sometimes inadvertently, sometimes deliberately. I had to learn how to strip those ideas off and choose a new set of ideas to assign. I learned how to identify what kind of ideas were worth keeping and using, and which ones were not and discard them. I know this doesn't really explain much how I see things now, and how I no longer feel depressed all the time, but I promise to share my story in the hopes of helping you understand how I got where I am, and maybe help you make a similar journey.",2,0,4379

5333,6986.0,"It's a terrible feeling when you try to hold on to even the most minuscule things that bring you any slight amount of joy, and one by one those things get taken from you. What I try to do is work back on a route to the thing that would lead to getting the one thing that could be right. i.e. something that costs money makes you happy, but you don't make enough money; need a way to make more money; dedicate all free time to applying for better work. Or, feel lonely and haven't got anybody; need to find somebody to stop feeling like that; need to know best places to find somebody; research ways to meet people and put self into that situation. Or feel worthless; being of use to someone or something would make me feel less worthless; dedicate myself to making myself of use to someone who needs somebody; use free time aiding charity or institution where people need you, and you can feel needed. Honestly, I know it's not that easy a fix, and there will be more bumps to overcome. One of my larger problems is isolation and loneliness, and even having looked at places to go, I still haven't found the courage to put myself into a situation to meet people. But generating a simple starting point where you can do something easily achievable, even just through reading online about how to get started, can make you feel proactive and start to get you into a more productive feeling that maybe it won't be like that forever, and that there is a physical, tangible, mortal way to deal with the situation. So, I would recommend pick a small goal that CAN lead to some form of happiness and work towards that, rather than try to envision this great milestone of achieving happiness in one big leap. Helps you take it day by day a little easier, and I hope that would make each new day, if not better, at least consistent for you. Feel better soon, bud.",2,1,4427

It could be a simple as just playing the shit out of a stupid flash game, or clearing out all the spam in your email, or reorganising your room. Just find something to keep yourself moving. Writing can help too, just lay it all out there. Seeing your words outside your head can help break the downward spiral of thinking. If it's worse now then that means was better, and it will be eventually. Think of someone you can talk to, who knows you well, and just hit them up and say hi. Maybe a text, maybe an email, just remind yourself that you are not alone. It's a shitty battle but stick it out if you can. If you have a therapist try reaching out to one, and if you don't then see if you can get a friend or a parent to help you find one.

I never learned how to be an adult when it comes to relationships (of all kinds). Because society just developed that way, I guess. Everybody is on their damn phones.

5543,7121.0,"Yeah, this feeling is a strong one. Felt it consistently for a lot of my childhood and early adulthood. The truth is that I never dealt with it constructively, or at least in a way that could help me get to the root of that feeling. Part of the reason I think you and I are on this in the first place is because we were never taught how to deal with that feeling constructively. In my case, I used constant denial and self-numbing ... At some point, I just assumed the pit was a part of me I could choose to ignore. You seem to be actively trying to experience it. You are engaging your sadness, which is objectively good for working through depression. It may not be what you might call 'conventional' but everyone does their thing a little differently :) If what you are doing no longer works for you though, it might be best to start looking for other (healthy) ways of working through that discomfort. Personally, when I feel that pit, I know what thoughts tend to follow it. Fortunately, my therapists (and my stay at hospital) helped me come up with ways to attack that pit when it hit me hard. In order to redirect those thoughts that create it, I try to reach out to anyone in my support net. It's hard because I feel like they won't give a shit, but most of the time, they do (but I often choose to ignore that reality). Or I will simply write some positive words here, on this. Reaching out to others here in positive ways is not just for others, but for my own sake as well. As you put so well, giving that pit a 'purpose'. But don't cover that feeling up.

But once I'm there, I'm often the Life of the Party, or so I think. I had people coming up to me, greeting me by my name and telling me how much fun they had last time we had met each other. Which was a year ago. For the first and last time since. I barely remembered their faces and not a single name. So I guess I left an impression. I really like to banter, to do play on words and take words from their mouth and turn them around in a fun way. I joke and tell stories with expressive facial expressions and big gestures. I'm sarcastic, sometimes even cynical. And I joke a lot about myself, mostly in a non-flattering way. I think people like me in general, I seldomly had someone outright refuse to interact with me. But on the other hand, as soon as I come home, I feel a crushing void and I feel alone and that everything is pointless. Those feelings remain in my day-to-day life. And it starts to interfere with my work, for example. I am not one to contain my feelings in an enviroment where I spend most of my days and life in. My boss already told me once, in a pretty long phase of being really depressed, that even my collegues said that something must be seriously wrong and the have no fun working around and with me if I'm in such mood. I can be fun at work, too. I made my co-workers laugh on a lot f different occasions. But that happens in good phases. But there are very bad phases where I, at best, don't say a single word all day unless absolutly necessary and at worst, I am filled with rage the whole day and can't contain it. Last week I was as close to quitting my job as I was never before. Maybe it would be best for all.  Whatever, long story short: I think I can be really funny, too.

5579,7141.0,"I tend to go back to sleep over and over, and I eat at dinner time. spend the nights playing video games and then I oversleep. I need a balance of alone time and time with friends to start feeling like myself again, and if I get that balance wrong I can meltdown. I tend to downplay my problems to the people around me and upplay them to strangers. For example, inflate things for the sake of a conversation with some crisis volunteer or something, just to get some free sympathy and support that I have to feel weird about later because I see that person again. But, if a friend asks me how doing, my first reaction is to reply I have good friends so they call me out on this. I self sabotage by missing appointments or shutting out natural light. If cold, thirsty, hungry or uncomfortable, I ignore it and let myself suffer. I know getting better when I start doing certain things for myself. If I make myself some tea or get more blankets or sit somewhere other than my bed, I tell myself because I care about myself and want to feel better. I have physical pain associated with depression, usually I feel an ache in my arms and legs. When I have the energy I stretch to alleviate it. This also helps me feel better. I have to be conscious of whether I have the energy to do something, because if I force myself I could get overwhelmed and just sink further down. had to learn to say no to people when what they ask of me is more than I can provide without suffering later. But, for the most part, learned my depression will leave when good and ready. been going downhill for two months and had a meltdown a few nights ago so been thinking a lot about what I really need to get through these times. These depressed phases tend to last 4-6 months for me so still got a long way to go. This my first rodeo, though, prepared. learned that there are plenty of little things I can do that feel like self care. Self care is not always an elaborate bath with essential oils and red wine. To me self care is getting up to make a cup of tea, spending a couple minutes stretching, or ordering food when hungry instead of waiting until everything is closed and starving. It have to make you feel better all at once, but all those little things add up, and it means more when you put conscious value on it. will stretch so my body hurt so much, and I do this because I care about feeling I say to myself.

I eventually learned to handle rejection, but full time work drove me to drug abuse. Now, I can handle working 50 hours a week. The point is I have always had terrible coping skills. None of my problems have ever been that bad, but they have been the biggest problem I ever faced. They always seem overwhelming because I don't know how to handle failure of rejection of really any kind of pain or even mild discomfort. I am a wimp.

Tells us not to burden others with our problems. Demands we keep our pain in the shadows. But this is the nasty cycle that keeps us locked in to our loneliness. We feel lonely, hate that we feel lonely, feel stupid for looking weak, and decide to keep it hidden. We find worth in our connection to others. Not because they decide if we are worthy or not, but simply because our ability to contribute what is in us is only useful in light of others. I'm not sure of your circumstances, but I can tell you that I have been in your shoes. I have felt completely cut off from the world. I have laid in bed night after night, wondering why I should even be here. I have been so lost and hard on myself that I couldn't even look at my face in the mirror. I have broken down in just about every room of the places I lived and expected it to never change. But it did. Not all at once. It took time.

If you want to study and pass your exams, this is what I did: - Get busy studying now (within 15 minutes). No excuses to eat/drink a bit. Not going to the bathroom. Just study. Phone away. If possible laptop/computer away. Do this for at least one hour and take a small break to get fresh air if you want and drink some water. NO PHONE. Then back to studying. Again one hour or more. - After studying go for a run (I don't care if it is 11 pm) or exercise in some other way. - Eat healthy. You crave good tasting food? chocolate? chips? No go. When you go to the supermarket, fast food is not an option. You will not spend your money on that shit. No chips, no sweet stuff, no special drinks. Fruit/vegetables/carbs/meat/fish/bread/milk/yoghurt. Healthy stuff. Lots of water. - Go to bed on time. Get out of bed on time. - No thinking! Only actions. - Do one thing at a time. No thinking about tomorrow or the next hours. Just about the next minute. What are you going to do now? Shower? check. Dress? check. Breakfast? check. Go to library? check. Study one hour? check. Have a small break and drink water? check. continue. - If possible, study with other people - (added) When I get stuck, it has been VERY helpful for me to discuss this with other students. This has been very difficult for me, because I have a crazy amount of pride and am very ashamed of showing I do not understand something. Nonetheless, it has helped me so much to just discuss a problem where i got stuck with someone and then see the light which enables me to continue studying (instead of procrastinating till everything went to shit). This doesn't solve the deeper problems, but it probably will get you through your exams as good as possible. At least, this is how I managed to finish my undergraduate years. Not healthy, but it worked. Also you will probably find that by being so hard for yourself, setting boundaries and actually following them, you will start to feel a lot better about yourself and gain confidence.

College is better for most people, but the partying and crap is highly overrated once you're old enough to look back a bit. I don't know anyone who misses that stuff. But what are the best years? I think once you hit your mid-20s things really start to look up. Odds are, your career is at least starting to actually materialize, you aren't as emotionally immature anymore and things don't bother you like they used to, and generally speaking the odds are that things are more stable overall.

5909,7336.0,"To answer your question, I'm actually feeling alright today. Had an existential crisis last night and probably would have ended up killing myself or at the very least cutting myself if it wasn't for my dog licking my hand as I layed in bed crying myself to sleep (she's NEVER an affectionate dog, it took me a minute to even realise that she was actually licking my hand and I wasn't imagining shit). Thanks, Charlie. Anyways, for me depression is like absolute insanity. It's not just sadness or feeling like killing myself every other week. Just pure insanity. The best example I can give is probably two years ago, seventh grade. That was probably the lowest I had ever been. Every night when I went to sleep, I'd stay up on my phone. Not because I wanted to be, because it kept me from going to sleep and having the same nightmares I had every night. And then I'd look at the time, which by now was probably about 12 AM, realise how absolutely sad and pathetic I was and turn on some emo music, usually being something like Set it Off's I'll Sleep When I'm Dead and listen to that as I (literally) sadistically laugh and cry myself to sleep. Some nights, that kind of stuff never happened. I'd have a peaceful sleep. Some nights I'd stay up all night debating whether I should text the suicide hotline, doing so, and it being no help whatsoever. So I'd get, maybe six hours of sleep at most. Before I'm woken up and have to get ready for school. How am I woken up? By my parents during the best part of my dream or the most peaceful part of my nightmare. Which already started my day off terribly. Then for an hour I'd be in the bathroom once again listening to emo music as I let the shower water run. My favourite songs to listen to were usually just about anything by Hollywood Undead. Not something a twelve year old should be listening to, sure. But it was a way to cope with my depression. As I listen to those songs, once again sadistically laughing at my own pain and often times end up cutting myself. I never cut myself deep, I was far to afraid of doing that. But... I enjoyed seeing the blood come out. I didn't cut for any sort of high or release of pain. It was sort of hard to explain. I was never addicted to cutting, I could stop or start whenever I wanted. Sometimes stopping for months at a time, but seeing the blood, made me feel happy. If you could have seen my eyes, especially when I cut myself, you wouldn't have seen any traces of a twelve year old. You'd see an insane person desperately trying to grasp on to the last straw of sanity, but nothing else. Some days I'd debate whether I should do a sort of murder-suicide thing. Or at the very least murder those who have caused me pain and suffering. Sometimes I'd have very and scarily elaborate plans on how I'd trick, kidnap, or kill my family. Things that you'd never expect from a twelve year old. But quite frankly, I might have physically been twelve, but my depression had probably aged and matured me way faster. The ride to school was probably the most traumatic for me. The ride was only about ten minutes (five minutes to school, five minutes in the carpool line). But those ten minutes were full of tests streaming down my face, me punching myself or ripping my hair out, or destroying my notebooks or pencils. Sometimes because I just really didn't want to go to school. Sometimes because my social anxiety got the best of me. Sometimes for reasons I don't even know. Me and my grandma would usually sit at the front of the school for about an hour or two, I'm sitting there trying to find a way to hurt myself because I'm angry, but don't want to let my anger out on her, and she's crying because she's absolutely lost on how to help me. I'd usually end up getting to school about a good three hours late. In school, I don't remember anything. Maybe it's because I was just walking around the school like a robot. Class for an hour, find your next class, repeat. In class, I'd have my head down in a book (not paying attention to the teacher whatsoever), I'd be mindlessly reciting the emo songs I listen to in my head, or I'd be talking to my friend AIDEN. (Yes, his name is in all caps). What I do definitely remember is hating all of my peers. Hell, I still hate them. It's not my hatred for them itself. It's just I can't stand how immature, idiotic, and stupid they were. Like who the hell goes around sticking Tide pods in their mouths for views on social media? Or who thinks it's funny to go around telling people to kill themselves because you heard your favourite edgy YouTuber say it and now you think it's hilarious to do so. Or why do you think it's cool and okay to curse every five seconds and use the N-word? Or why do you think that because you saw Kim Kardashian half naked in some photo shoot that you can show up to school with hardly any clothes on or sag and talk about fucking whores because your favourite rapper said it in their newest song? Act your own god damn age, quit trying to act like someone three times your age while being as immature as a kindergartener. More on AIDEN: AIDEN sort of just appeared out of nowhere. I don't know when or why I came up with him, I just sort of did. I'm not schizophrenic, he was 100% my own voice talking back to me in my head, but I enjoyed pretending to have someone to talk to. Someone who walked around with me everyday, knew exactly what I was thinking, and could relate to me all the time. Someone who (though was just my own voice), talked me out of suicide many times back in 7th grade. But slowly I started treating AIDEN a lot more like a real person. To the point where I could have easily been mistaken as someone with schizophrenia. At home I'd just go into my room and basically lock myself in. My door was never locked, my parents could come in and out as they pleased, but I would just hand out under the covers all day. I didn't want to see light, light didn't want to see me. I didn't bother with homework. I figured, I fail, I fail. I really had just given up with life at that point. The only reason why I hadn't killed myself was probably because I was too sad and lazy to bother trying. Occasionally I'd talk to AIDEN or watch YouTube or something, but most times I ended up listening to hypnosis. Hypnosis for me was like a way to escape real life. Like meditation, but instead of being left alone with my sad and depressing thoughts, I could listen to someone else. At first it was a nice little escape, but then it more or less because an addiction. An odd strange one that I'd never be able to explain to anyone, but an addiction none the less. I'd try to listen to hypnosis any time I could even if that meant going into my room away from family to listen to it. It kind of gave me the same high that cutting, smoking, drugs, or porn give other people. Even though it was just hypnosis, it really did become unhealthy. Before I knew it, it was time for me to go to bed. And then the whole cycle would repeat itself over and over and over and over and over again. It was the same routine, same schedule, same insanity over and over again. This sounds like more is going on than just depression, right? Like some other underlying mental illness. But this is all depression and a bit of social anxiety. No MPD, no schizophrenia, no bipolar disorder, I'm not a psychopath or sociopath. This was all thanks to my depression. No one actually knew how bad my mental state was. I never told anyone. I was diagnosed with depression and put on meds, but if anyone really knew how bad it was, I likely truly would have been put in a mental health hospital. This is where the most insane part was, since being on my meds, I'm a lot more stable. But I miss being the way I was. Even though they were supposed to, my meds didn't help my depression. It really just made me more stable. Now without AIDEN or cutting myself or the enjoyment of listening to emo music as I sadistically laugh and cry at the same time, I just feel empty. Though I was completely fucked up, it was still fun a times to laugh at how much I hate myself and my life. Now I can't do those things anymore. It's like being insane was a big part of me and my depression. The insanity itself was taken away, but the depression was still left. Now there's just a big, empty, dark hole.",2,0,5941

I used to be depressed over my bad grades and I had this constant anxious feeling that my life was over because of these bad grades and I would amount to nothing. Then all of a sudden one day, I noticed that bad grades in high school aren't the end of the world. It might have been because I moved out of my Dad's place and I didn't have to hear him call me a failure anymore. Either way, I became happy again. Then I met her. A nice girl who was my age. She had a pretty face, we had a ton of classes together, and she thought I was really funny. I was able to open up to her. I think (I know) I fell in love with her. She had a boyfriend though. He's a shitty person. He's high all the time and he always flirts around with other girls. I really thought she would break it off with him and find her way to my arms and I'd be the happiest guy in the world. That didn't happen. I became desperate. I began to have a drinking problem because of it. One night while very drunk I texted her a bunch of things about my depression. I don't think she cares about me anymore.

5930,7349.0,"I'm game and need to vent so here goes... I was verbally, physically and emotionally abused for as long as I can recall. Since you asked about emotional abuse I will focus solely on that. I was blamed constantly for everything that was wrong with the family. My mother told me this numerous times after she and my father would have huge, physically violent fights that started over events that had nothing to do with me. I was constantly told If you had a brain you would be dangerous. by my mother. Not after I'd done anything, not after a stupid act or action on my part but just in passing. This was my mother's assesment of me and she told me this frequently. I was tested, determined to have a high IQ, placed in gifted and talented classes and made to suffer for it by narcissistic, superficial, egotistical mother for my entire life. If I vot an A I was told it was because the work was too easy for me, if I got a B it was because I was lazy and never applied myself. I would constantly be accused of thinking I was So smart. Nothing I ever did or attempted to do was good enough, there was always some flaw in it. I only received criticism, never any praise. In 4th grade I had lovely long hair, my mother decided I should have it all cut off. She took me to a beauty school and had them cut all of my hair off, a boy cut, they shaved the back of my neck. My mom cried afterward and said she was crying because The haircut showed how ugly I was. The next week we were going into our small town to pick up this giant fancy framed picture for our living room, My mom made me walk on the opposite side of the street after we got out of the car. She said, I don't want to be seen with you and have people know you are my daughter. My mother really values externak beauty. I was a skinny unremarlable child, I never forgot the other side of the street incident, I had to look at the damn framed picture that we picked up that day until I moved away from home and got married at age 19. Every time I saw it I thought of that day. Years of torture. I was a divorced single mother, my ex never paid a dime, not any of the support we were supposed to receive. I worked two jobs to support us. I never received any financial help from anyone. I crafted a nice career for myself and tried to be a good mom and a good person. I never drank, never did drugs or ran around or went wild or got in any trouble. But my mother was/is ashamed of me and made/makes sure to let me know it. Anyone she talks about to me she lets me know how successful their children are, how wealthy they are and how proud the parents are. My mom told me one day how disappointed she was with how I'd turned out, how she always thought I'd be someone when I grew up. She said she'd hoped I would've grown up to marry a doctor or lawyer or someone important. I told her I was someone. At the time I was an online database adminstrator with a nationally recognized nonprofit but to my mother I was an embarrassment, a nothing and a nobody. My mother's father, my grandfather was one of the only people in my life that was always kind to me, he treated me like I was special and had value. My mother knew I adored him and she hated that he liked me. After he died she insisted on telling me horrible things about him saying she wanted me to know what kind of man the grandfather I worshipped really was and that I should not feel special that some thing like him tolerated me better than most. Right after I was divorced, I was not yet employed full time and very poor. I was visifing my parents at their huge house in the country. My mother started bitching about how poor I was, I had not asked her or dad for a dime and I was not there to eat. Mom started talking about dying, asked me if I had a sill, etc.. Mom told me I better not die because she did not want to have to spend her money on a funeral for me, and she said not that anyone would show up at a funeral for me anyway. She also told me that she'd always thought of me as a living abortion, since my birth. She was going nuts, yelling and spitting. She told me she bet I was so poor, such a failure that I probably could not even afford feminine products. I got my purse to leave, opened it and hurled a few tampons at her, as I told her, wrong bitch. My father blocked the front door, and tried to make me apologise to my mother. I had to threaten to call the police before he would let me go. After my father passed away my mother called, she said she needed to ask me something. Then mom said, Did you ever think or get the feeling that your father really loved you or cared about you? I told my mom that yes, yes I did. That dad was a fifties guy and although he may not have ever been emotionally demonstrative I thought he did love and care about me. He has worked hard and made personal sacrifices to care for us financially when I was young. That there had been a few occassions that he'd been very nice to me. Like going into a shop and buying me a top he knew I wanted for my 16th Birthday. Buying me a computer, working with me on computer projects early on, buying us both laptops, teaching me to shoot and fish, and by his having special nicknames and greetings for me, etc.. I told mom that was how dad expressed his love. My mother said, That's interesting because I always had the impression that he didn't care about you at all. I was also emotionally abused by my father, it was different than my mother's abuse though. My dad alwsys had to be the best. He could not stand for me to be good at anything I could never, ever be as good as he was or (god fobid it) better. My parents were never involved in our education. They basically just asked us at dinner how school was and we'd say OK and dinner would proceed. I should have known from past events not to dare say anything positive had happened but one day I was happy and excited about something that had happened at school, in English class. I was so excited that I stupidly spoke up at dinner. When the standard, How was school? question was asked I boldly said, School was great, Mrs. G, my English teacher pulled me aside after class. She told me a poem I'd written for an assignment was so good they want my permission to publish it on the first page of the student yearbook! My father put his fork down, he tilted his head, gave me a bizarre look and told me to recite the poem. I could not recite it, I was too nervous and afraid. I said I would show it to him after dinner, it was no big deal. No, dad wanted to hear this fabulous poem I had written, right then. I went and got the poem and started to read it out loud. Dad told me to give it to him to read. He told me if it was in the yearbook people woukd be reading it for themselves. Dad read it silently and then while scoffing and half laughing he read it aloud. Dad asked me if the idiots at my school really thought that was good writing? He said he bet he could write something right then that would be a hundred times better. Dad left the table and went to his desk while we all sat at the table waiting for his return. After about twenty minutes Dad cheerfully returned, poem in hand. He stood and read it to us. It was some lame poem with Brother can you spare me a dime as one of the lines. Dad then told us, See, that's a poem, that's what good poetry is like! After that he asked all of us, Wasn't my poem better, a lot better? We all agreed, and lied and said his poem was a lot better. I told the English teacher not to let them use my poem for the yearbook. I never wrote another poem or much else for that matter. That crap happened in 1975 and I am still not over it despite counseling. Another thing that was a form of emotional abuse was the family hierarchy. My father came first, then my sister or mother, then me. I.always came last, even though I was the eldest child. There was this thing with the food. If we had any serving size type of meat it came into play. Let's say it is steaks for dinner, they are on a platter. The largest steak is for Dad, younger sister gets the next largest, mom third largest and smallest was for me. It was like that with all of the food. It was an unwritten rule. I decided to challenge it once when the platter of Hamburgers was beside me. I knew better than to go for the one for Dad but tried to take the secind largest one. My mom was immediately shrieking at me, No, no, put that back, it's for your sister! Yours is the small one. My parents home has our family pictures hanging in the study, they are hung vertically on one wall. The order is from top to bottom, a picture of my dad, a picture of my mom, a picture of my sister, a picture of my son, then a picture of me. I.am at the very bottom, like always. I.endured physical, emotional and mental abuse. I've seen therapist on occasion over the years and at one point was in therapy sessions twice a week for a year. It helped but it hasn't enabled me forget. I just have to deal with what happened and move forward. I'm not social, I don't really trust anyone or have any close friends but I'm okay with that.

5948,7359.0,"That's a pretty profound question, but I think happiness is something that a lot of people don't understand. In a period or prolonged period of despair, I don't believe there can be happiness at all, and it's only after that period has been solved, over, attacked enough by effort and time, that you can start experiencing happiness. I don't think happiness and gratitude should be forced, or you should try to feel happy when you truly cannot feel happy. I'm still going through that period, and there might be rivets or jewels of happiness along the way, but they are fleeting and leave very quickly. The whole reason why people despair is because they are tied so strongly to negative emotional memories that they outweigh any trivial positive emotional memories. Think about it, which memories are the quickest, strongest, and most easily able to be remembered for you? The most emotional ones. If your most emotional memories are negative, you will be in despair. On the converse, if one's most emotional memories are positive, you will be in a state of happiness. There is a way to end your despair, you just have to face it head on and let go of everything, and keep trying to let go and accept. Very few people have any science on this and might be the thing we need to explore the most as a society as a whole.",2,1,6015
