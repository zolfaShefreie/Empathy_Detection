What concerns me more than the presence of these lows, however, is the complete absence of highs. In other words, I feel no joy whatsoever. I really don't remember the last time I did. Despite seeing a counselor regularly, working out 2-3 times each week, meditating daily, and trying out multiple medications, I've seen no improvement in that regard.

I've tried taking everything from excedrin to ibuprofen and neither do anything. I also find it incredibly difficult to concentrate and remember anymore, constantly needed things repeated over and over slowly.

I used to be depressed over my bad grades and I had this constant anxious feeling that my life was over because of these bad grades and I would amount to nothing. Then all of a sudden one day, I noticed that bad grades in high school aren't the end of the world. It might have been because I moved out of my Dad's place and I didn't have to hear him call me a failure anymore. Either way, I became happy again. Then I met her. A nice girl who was my age. She had a pretty face, we had a ton of classes together, and she thought I was really funny. I was able to open up to her. I think (I know) I fell in love with her. She had a boyfriend though. He's a shitty person. He's high all the time and he always flirts around with other girls. I really thought she would break it off with him and find her way to my arms and I'd be the happiest guy in the world. That didn't happen. I became desperate. I began to have a drinking problem because of it. One night while very drunk I texted her a bunch of things about my depression. I don't think she cares about me anymore. Now I find myself drunk and alone for the umpteenth time wondering how I let myself get depressed again.  Basically what I wanna say to you is: your life's not over, it's just beginning. Whatever it is that makes you feel like a failure is probably a problem that is possible to overcome. Just focus on you and don't let other people get in your way and bring you down like I did. Don't let anyone else determine your happiness. Control your life. You can do it.",2

Staying in bed awake for hours on weekdays, intentionally isolating myself or lying so I could be alone and mope. I stopped exercising and gained a ton of weight. Hell I even had suicidal ideation and I just thought it was normal. I want to kill myself but I stop thinking about death and me dying. It sometimes felt like if I stopped existing it would be fine. I knew something was wrong but I was adamant it depression. Then I went to my doctor thinking I had an anxiety problem and he began to ask THE questions. I knew he was trying to see if I had depression and it caught me by surprise. Of course I lied for most of them. It would be embarrassing; there was no way I was depressed, but the thought had worked its way in. Over the course of a year I did some idle research. I realized suicidal thoughts and a fascination with death are not normal. I matched a lot of my behavior to symptoms of depression. I came to accept it.

Joining a club at uni, having friends keep me motivated in my studies. Also sort of having something to do outside of classes (I don't have a job).  Make friends in your course, it helps to know you're not the only one in struggle town, and if you get stuck you can ask someone.  Also think hard about why you're studying what you're studying, be in it for the right reasons. Keep in mind university isn't for everyone, and it isn't the only way to lead a fulfilling life. Also career changes are very common so since you're in your final year you can just stick it out and know that the future awaits. You're not locked into doing whatever your degree says you have to do.  I think a lot of students are in the same boat, and good on you for making this post and trying to work out what you can do about it. Good luck!",2
7090,"It's an interesting thing. You have to feel that you're important regardless of what anybody feels at least that was the message that people gave to me (non verbal). I mean, when I was in HS I didn't feel important. I didn't have any friends or relationships and I thought me not finding work in HS was the main cause of that. These days, I have a job and i'm in college working on a STEM degree...Still no friends or relationships...not even a sign that anyone is interested. I have to find importance in myself first and I come before everyone period because there is a good chance that I will die before anybody chooses to realize that I exist.",2
7091,"it *probably* depends on the state (edit: what state in the US). being 14, you are going to be tethered to your parent/guardian legally. the therapist/counselor/psychologist will be legally required to tell your guardians of anything that serves of specific risk. for example, i told my therapist that i was suicidal and he had to contact my mother and explain the basics of the situation. for self harm, im not sure exactly how/if the information would be disclosed by the therapist/counselor/psychologist to your parents.. but im assuming if you are physically hurting yourself to a GREAT EXTENT then yes, it would most likely be disclosed. im 18 now, and started seeing my on-campus(university) therapist and psychiatrist at the beginning of the school year, where i was 17. it sucks not being in control of your life, but what can you do, you know? if getting to see a therapist is an issue, i would recommend asking to talk to your doctor/pediatrician in private (during a normal check-up) and say tht youve had symptoms of depression/anxiety and you'd like to have some help talking to your parent about getting help. if it's not an issue of talking to your parent/guardian, then what's the worry? if you cant see a doctor, a school counselor could help you have this conversation with your parent! or even a supportive teacher that you trust. i went through a very similar situation when i was younger, and very much regret not being more persistent about getting help when i needed it. it mght not go away, and with school only getting harder and more stressful as you age, it's *really hard* to deal with all this emotional baggage. everyone deserves to feel the best that they can. you dont want to suffer anymore and someday you wont! feel free to pm me, i'd be happy to be your pen-pal through all this &lt;3",2

7095,"Life is not what happens to you - it's how you react to it.  If you feel sorry for yourself, and most depressed people do, it's because they decide that there is a payoff in doing it. It's showing sympathy for a person, and you're the person, because you aren't getting it from anyone else.  It all comes down to what comes after that. You can give up and never try again, or you can take that feeling and extend it into the future:  - Imagine feeling this way, and doing nothing about it, for a year. 5 years. 10 years. What has your life become?  - Now imagine what your life would be like if you forced yourself to get of bed, brush your teeth, went to the store or coffee shop, talked to someone, helped someone, every day. Now imagine doing that for a year. 5 years. 10 years. NOW what is your life like?",0

7099,"Hi Talk2muchaa, Lik onus111 suggested, 'feeling like doing something' just does not happen. If you're deeply unhappy with a lack of activity in your life, you just need to force yourself to do it - That's the sad reality of it. HOWEVER, that doesn't mean that there aren't ways to make FORCING yourself 'easier' on your mind and less stressful. If you want to build a house consisting of a 1000 bricks, take 30 seconds a day to lay 3 bricks and in one year, you will have a house. You can't punish yourself for not building Rome in a day. You will go on Twitch and see streamers who are making millions... YouTubers who are making millions. I mean fuck, PewDiePie has 56 million subscribers. But that shit didn't happen in just one day. You need to break shit up into increments. Perhaps others don't have to do this. But it's the only way I've found to get anything done. If you want to learn a language, go on Duolingo. Set a '10 points per day' challenge. Yes, it's jack-shit in terms of work. It takes literally 2 minutes a day, BUT- it's something. Try and ignore your brain saying Increase the goal to 50 a day, we're getting fuck-all done because this will break your discipline and you'll go back to 0 a day. Consistently doing 10 a day for 11 days, is better than doing 50 a day for 2 days, burning out and stopping altogether. The key to beating depression-induced laziness is TINY, incremental steps. For example, I'm learning Calculus on Khan Academy. One. Lesson. A Day. That's right- the average Khan video is around 10 minutes. I do one video a day. I am slowly, but consistently learning. Each day I go over the notes from the previous day. The problem isn't volume- it's consistency.",0

7127,"Ok, how deeply did you cut yourself and with what? If it is bleeding a lot, clean it up, run it under water, don't let the blood dry and go nasty. Pat it dry. Bandage it up, if you can. Also if you have some antiseptic cream, use some of that on it. Don't drink any more for now, maybe try and get some sleep or have a nice bath or shower or watch tv or something so you can calm down. Please see a professional- a doctor or a therapist or something. Self harm is very serious. I have been doing it for many years, and it is a difficult addiction to break out of. If you feel the urge to cut again, take a deep breath, count to 10. Write your feelings down or draw them out, even if you don't think you're a great artist or whatever. It will help to get the emotions out. Do you have a good friend you can talk to about it? Or a pet or even a stuffed toy? Talking helps. I'm sorry you're feeling this way.

Today you just experienced how getting things done is what made you feel good. Too many people want to feel good first, and then act. Most times it works in the opposite way, act first and feel good after. You don't have to be at the mercy of waiting for these random days when you suddenly get something done. Make it happen. Life is like a game of momentum and inertia. Even doing something small is better than nothing. I like the mentality of trying not to have any Zero days. Don't let a day go by where you did absolutely nothing productive. It only takes something small to qualify as more than zero.

I realize now that everyone goes through the same type of things and you can't fight them. Adults have the same issues with heartbreak and money trouble as teens, the only difference is they think they're experienced. No one is experienced. Everything that happens to you is the first time that unique situation happened to your unique person. Your reaction is the only thing that changes how these events affect you. I know it's generalizing a bit, but if only good things happen to happy people, it's because those people tend to focus on the good things that happen to them and view the bad things that happen as an obstacle that they need to overcome.

And as time progresses the person is not just simply a partner but a friend whom is apart of the very foundation our life is build upon. I am not sure why you two broke up. And i know it hurts extremely bad, and life has lost much of its meaning. I will it try to come up with some lighthearted crap that tells you everything is going to disappear quickly. This will be tough, this will hurt, and at times it will feel like nothing at all is worth living for. But i must tell you this feeling is temporary..... it will not last forever. How long it will last i cannot say, when it will end i cannot say either. But take it one day at a time. Do things that are only necessary for your existence. And those that are extra if you are not up to it do it. Within the relationship i am sure there were flaws on both parts, beat yourself up about them. When the time is right started to fix those things. And if in months or weeks time you feel like you want to reach out to see if anything can be rekindled do so. But you as a person have to stand alone so if or when this may happen it will not shake your entire life. Become strong from this.",2
7187,"I try to cope by trying to keep my own goals from the past that were broken, alongside those i may make in the current time, intact for myself. Whether or not that can happen or if it's meant to be for me, i don't and honestly can't know, unless and until i get there from still trying. I am living, but not alive -- there is a difference; I'm trying to find completion for that void. I try to accept myself and my flaws -- even some of the current ones i want gone as i progress towards that. I still fight myself over that and/or other things at times. But i still try to accept and understand. I just keep going. For the sake of something i still believe in somewhere out there that might be befitting of me, as i want it. If it's there, i must get to it -- i must have it. At the same time, i must better myself until i am who and what I've always wanted to be, both in and out. The sense of failure and futility are always there -- i just keep trying to keep them level and not overwhelm me. I try to do things for myself i thought i had from others. Things i would truly want done to me by others. But there's nobody. I got used to it. Despite still wanting the opposite in my own humble way. I just think of what who might actually still exist out there, think and feel if i weren't doing this, willingly, to keep pushing. I keep trying to believe that regardless, i deserve things my way. After everything especially. That it can't all be for naught. I've yet to see that. That's why I'm still going for the future. Even if its path got shattered long-ago, many-a-time. I hope this helps.",0
7188,"Are you putting forth the sacrifice needed to change such? Have you identified if you would sooner live a lie, or live a truth? Ask a blunt person the truth. Life is inherently a horrible experience covered up by meaningless stimulations that give the illusion of better. A bandage on the mortal wound of monotony and uselessness. How many people have you met that make you feel better? How many things in your life bring you outside the feeling of depression? For me there is nothing. I am a dirty old man, white, with red hair and bad teeth. I am despised and loathed by ninety percent of the population. People actively move out of my vicinity as if my very being is a contagion they might contract. The people who don't actively run, are despicable lunatics, selfish and narcissistic beyond redemption. wOE! Woe is me!",0

So, been times where I was the only single guy in the room. I say anything, but deep down it kind of hurts. I help but think I just I realize that not something I could say to anyone else. I could never look at anyone call them unlovable. So why can I say it myself? Why do we think such nasty thoughts about ourselves? My friend, you do deserve love, and I hope that it comes to you. :)  Oh, and social media is terrible for this type of feeling btw. been staying off Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat lately.

I want to end this fucking pain.",2
7200,"Getting a job is pretty stressful when you're feeling down. It doesn't help that sometimes finding a job, or the right job at least, is pretty stressful itself.  What I found is that volunteering is a great stepping stone on the path to getting a job and being more comfortable around people. Volunteer gigs are pretty easy to find and land, and the people who also volunteer tend to be nice people as well.  If that's something interesting to you, call up your local churches and ask about volunteering opportunities. As an added bonus, volunteering work looks good on some job applications.",2
7201,"Well look, I see your confusion, but not really asking a question. not really giving yourself a chance to construct something that will give you a leg to stand on when it comes to your own consideration. asking these rhetorical questions, like, what? supposed to have kids? supposed to do something Those things are up to you, but if you find value in them then you keep looking for validation there.  It sounds like trying to work backwards from what you think makes other lives worth living, what you think validates their lives. But a vexed approach. Those things may enrich a experience and situations, but they confer meaning and significance in and of a cart before the horse thing. We get value from lists of attributes, you just plug in these arbitrary conditions and get a happy human that lives an engaging life. And, more importantly, you fixate on those attributes and dream that those magical little things are what stand between you and your sense of fulfillment and worth. You have to start smaller and construct that sense of purpose and wellbeing piece by piece. You have to make little investments in your immediate world that contribute something to that.",0

7206,"Yeah, unfortunately the side effects from them can be really strong, especially if its your first time trying them, I lost a lot of sleep from stomach pains when I was first prescribed them. That said they side-effects should pass fairly quickly as your body adapts to the meds but if it is causing you a serious problem, talk to your doctor, they can often start you off on a smaller dosage and work their way up to a level that can help you.",2
7207,"You are capable of doing things on your own. If your boyfriend doesn't make you happy, you don't have to be with him. If you are worried about coping, you can take things slowly, step by step. I should follow my own advice here as well: don't be afraid to seek therapy if you can. It will help, even if it only helps a little.  As for your job, I'm sorry it didn't work out. But don't let things ruminate in your mind. Worrying about them over and over does nothing to help you. *Depression thrives in rumination*. Try looking into mindfulness meditation. It's not spiritual garbage, it's literally training the neural pathways in your brain to put less weight on particular thoughts, so that you don't get stuck in negative feedback loops. It takes time to change your brain structure, but it can be done. Another thing is to find distractions. Productive is better, but if you keep the less productive ones in check they can be helpful also. Delve into hobbies or learn a new skill. Be social and try new things. That's the best way to cope in my opinion. I need to take my own advice.",0

7214,"When my depression was at its worst, I was lost as to what would make me feel better. I thought about what the kid version of me would think was impressive if the adult version of me actually did it. I remembered I'd always been fascinated by the seemingly impossible idea of doing a triathlon. I signed up for an Olympic distance one (way way less than an Ironman but still seemed like an almost impossible feat for me at the time) and 6 months later, I crossed the finish line. It felt good to complete and it felt good to be healthier than I'd ever been. Being fit and healthy is going to help manage depression, (/r/eood and /r/fitness are both great places) but maybe that's not your bag. Can you think of any goal that you have now (or one you can resurrect from the past) that you KNOW you'd feel great about completing?",2
7215,"I can tell you this much: If you can tell whether or not the medication is making a positive difference, then I'd say that it's worth enduring the negative side effects. As a side note, I feel like I've heard of/known people who eventually weened themselves off of their meds and ended up not needing them, but it's probably different from person to person. I have no idea what the future holds for you, and there's probably no definitive way to predict how things will end up for you and your medication, so good luck.",2

I don't think it would be really all as great as it gets built up in my mind to be.  I think the biggest thing is the difficulty building up and sustaining interest in things to distract myself with.

I also recommend other methods, there are plenty out there that can cause some pretty gnarly pain but are far, far safer than cutting. Are there any taps in your house that have overly hot water? Boiling water shouldn't be used as it will scald and is just as prone to infection and other nasties as cutting, so just try clenching a fist under the regular hot water for a few seconds. On the other end of the scale I found the grabing an ice cube and squeezing as tight as I could helped!

7280,"Freshman in high school or college? If HS, you can get a work permit at 15 I think. You're supposed to have one as long as you're working and under 18. As for finding one at that age most people I know went into food or retail. Coffee shops, fast food, some with cars did pizza delivery. Theaters usually higher younger people. They're simple jobs that don't require a lot of training and younger employees help keep younger crowds coming in. There should be someone at your school like a counselor with info on work permits. Edit: its also great that you want to work. Having the money can give you more breathing room with bills and you can start building some retirement money. Plus having the experience will help get better jobs. Just remember you don't have to save everything. If all you do is work and your money goes right back out to food/bills/rent/etc, work will become a burden. Put aside a little bit each paycheck as a whatever fund. It wont be much at first but after a few months you'll have a good bit of change set aside. Wanna go for a weekend getaway? Do it. Looking for a new TV. Buy it. I usually set aside $100 month and typically buy something I'd wanted after a few months but couldn't normally justify. Worked out well.

There is always a reason, why some things happen. The reason is, to teach you a lesson.  For example: if you have no friends (like me), see it as negative. Try to find the lesson behind this experience. In this case, life wants to tell you, that loneliness is not what you, in your deepest self, want. You need persons such as friends around you. Take a desicion now, that you want to be lonely anymore, and life will listen to you and bring you friends again, and if it work, try to know, why it (i know the answer, but a bit complicated (msg me if you want to know)) and what the lesson in this experience is.  Also: Life is like a mirror. If you feel lonely inside, the outside world will deliver you that loneliness. pretty simple. So if you want to be lonely anymore, try not to feel lonely (i know fking hard, but you can reach that with more knowledge about the truth (msg me if you want to know more). If you feel lonely inside, that means, that the outside world will automaticlly deliver you NOT-loneliness, which means new persons will enter your life.

7287,I feel your inner turmoil and pain. I'm not sure of your age or history but I was married for 14 years (no children) and have lived on my own the last eight. It hasn't been easy. It's not fun. There were times I didn't trust myself alone and I recognized that I needed to take steps to help myself so I sought out therapy and it has been helping tremendously (both the one-on-one therapy and resulting meds).  Do you have a therapist? Do you have access to one? If so I highly recommend going. It's one of those things that carries almost no risk - it can only help.,2

I've had depression for a couple of years now, and giving up seems like the only option most of the time but at some point I understood that there is at least one person that will care about you. You don't need to talk to them about it to know that they care, you just realize at one point that they enjoy being with you, and that you enjoy being with them, and if you aren't going to fight it for yourself, you should do it for them.",2

Counseling is a sympathetic ear who will NEVER downplay things bringing you stress. I've been depressed. I've been suicidal. The worst part is the sincere feeling that nothing will EVER get better.

I went off and I'm on gabapentin now, and melatonin, and that usually keeps the insomnia at bay. I used to tell myself meds were a weakness, but being on them is far better than getting fired from a job, which was in the cards if I hadn't gone to see a therapist. I know it feels shameful, but really, it's no different than needing glasses, or a coat when it's cold. If your current meds help you, stay on them, and don't feel bad about it.",2

7316,"I'm game and need to vent so here goes... I was verbally, physically and emotionally abused for as long as I can recall. Since you asked about emotional abuse I will focus solely on that. I was blamed constantly for everything that was wrong with the family. My mother told me this numerous times after she and my father would have huge, physically violent fights that started over events that had nothing to do with me. I was constantly told If you had a brain you would be dangerous. by my mother. Not after I'd done anything, not after a stupid act or action on my part but just in passing. This was my mother's assesment of me and she told me this frequently. I was tested, determined to have a high IQ, placed in gifted and talented classes and made to suffer for it by narcissistic, superficial, egotistical mother for my entire life. If I vot an A I was told it was because the work was too easy for me, if I got a B it was because I was lazy and never applied myself. I would constantly be accused of thinking I was So smart. Nothing I ever did or attempted to do was good enough, there was always some flaw in it. I only received criticism, never any praise. In 4th grade I had lovely long hair, my mother decided I should have it all cut off. She took me to a beauty school and had them cut all of my hair off, a boy cut, they shaved the back of my neck. My mom cried afterward and said she was crying because The haircut showed how ugly I was. The next week we were going into our small town to pick up this giant fancy framed picture for our living room, My mom made me walk on the opposite side of the street after we got out of the car. She said, I don't want to be seen with you and have people know you are my daughter. My mother really values externak beauty. I was a skinny unremarlable child, I never forgot the other side of the street incident, I had to look at the damn framed picture that we picked up that day until I moved away from home and got married at age 19. Every time I saw it I thought of that day. Years of torture. I was a divorced single mother, my ex never paid a dime, not any of the support we were supposed to receive. I worked two jobs to support us. I never received any financial help from anyone. I crafted a nice career for myself and tried to be a good mom and a good person. I never drank, never did drugs or ran around or went wild or got in any trouble. But my mother was/is ashamed of me and made/makes sure to let me know it. Anyone she talks about to me she lets me know how successful their children are, how wealthy they are and how proud the parents are. My mom told me one day how disappointed she was with how I'd turned out, how she always thought I'd be someone when I grew up. She said she'd hoped I would've grown up to marry a doctor or lawyer or someone important. I told her I was someone. At the time I was an online database adminstrator with a nationally recognized nonprofit but to my mother I was an embarrassment, a nothing and a nobody. My mother's father, my grandfather was one of the only people in my life that was always kind to me, he treated me like I was special and had value. My mother knew I adored him and she hated that he liked me. After he died she insisted on telling me horrible things about him saying she wanted me to know what kind of man the grandfather I worshipped really was and that I should not feel special that some thing like him tolerated me better than most. Right after I was divorced, I was not yet employed full time and very poor. I was visifing my parents at their huge house in the country. My mother started bitching about how poor I was, I had not asked her or dad for a dime and I was not there to eat. Mom started talking about dying, asked me if I had a sill, etc.. Mom told me I better not die because she did not want to have to spend her money on a funeral for me, and she said not that anyone would show up at a funeral for me anyway. She also told me that she'd always thought of me as a living abortion, since my birth. She was going nuts, yelling and spitting. She told me she bet I was so poor, such a failure that I probably could not even afford feminine products. I got my purse to leave, opened it and hurled a few tampons at her, as I told her, wrong bitch. My father blocked the front door, and tried to make me apologise to my mother. I had to threaten to call the police before he would let me go. After my father passed away my mother called, she said she needed to ask me something. Then mom said, Did you ever think or get the feeling that your father really loved you or cared about you? I told my mom that yes, yes I did. That dad was a fifties guy and although he may not have ever been emotionally demonstrative I thought he did love and care about me. He has worked hard and made personal sacrifices to care for us financially when I was young. That there had been a few occassions that he'd been very nice to me. Like going into a shop and buying me a top he knew I wanted for my 16th Birthday. Buying me a computer, working with me on computer projects early on, buying us both laptops, teaching me to shoot and fish, and by his having special nicknames and greetings for me, etc.. I told mom that was how dad expressed his love. My mother said, That's interesting because I always had the impression that he didn't care about you at all. I was also emotionally abused by my father, it was different than my mother's abuse though. My dad alwsys had to be the best. He could not stand for me to be good at anything I could never, ever be as good as he was or (god fobid it) better. My parents were never involved in our education. They basically just asked us at dinner how school was and we'd say OK and dinner would proceed. I should have known from past events not to dare say anything positive had happened but one day I was happy and excited about something that had happened at school, in English class. I was so excited that I stupidly spoke up at dinner. When the standard, How was school? question was asked I boldly said, School was great, Mrs. G, my English teacher pulled me aside after class. She told me a poem I'd written for an assignment was so good they want my permission to publish it on the first page of the student yearbook! My father put his fork down, he tilted his head, gave me a bizarre look and told me to recite the poem. I could not recite it, I was too nervous and afraid. I said I would show it to him after dinner, it was no big deal. No, dad wanted to hear this fabulous poem I had written, right then. I went and got the poem and started to read it out loud. Dad told me to give it to him to read. He told me if it was in the yearbook people woukd be reading it for themselves. Dad read it silently and then while scoffing and half laughing he read it aloud. Dad asked me if the idiots at my school really thought that was good writing? He said he bet he could write something right then that would be a hundred times better. Dad left the table and went to his desk while we all sat at the table waiting for his return. After about twenty minutes Dad cheerfully returned, poem in hand. He stood and read it to us. It was some lame poem with Brother can you spare me a dime as one of the lines. Dad then told us, See, that's a poem, that's what good poetry is like! After that he asked all of us, Wasn't my poem better, a lot better? We all agreed, and lied and said his poem was a lot better. I told the English teacher not to let them use my poem for the yearbook. I never wrote another poem or much else for that matter. That crap happened in 1975 and I am still not over it despite counseling. Another thing that was a form of emotional abuse was the family hierarchy. My father came first, then my sister or mother, then me. I.always came last, even though I was the eldest child. There was this thing with the food. If we had any serving size type of meat it came into play. Let's say it is steaks for dinner, they are on a platter. The largest steak is for Dad, younger sister gets the next largest, mom third largest and smallest was for me. It was like that with all of the food. It was an unwritten rule. I decided to challenge it once when the platter of Hamburgers was beside me. I knew better than to go for the one for Dad but tried to take the secind largest one. My mom was immediately shrieking at me, No, no, put that back, it's for your sister! Yours is the small one. My parents home has our family pictures hanging in the study, they are hung vertically on one wall. The order is from top to bottom, a picture of my dad, a picture of my mom, a picture of my sister, a picture of my son, then a picture of me. I.am at the very bottom, like always. I.endured physical, emotional and mental abuse. I've seen therapist on occasion over the years and at one point was in therapy sessions twice a week for a year. It helped but it hasn't enabled me forget. I just have to deal with what happened and move forward. I'm not social, I don't really trust anyone or have any close friends but I'm okay with that. TLDR: Emotionally abused, made me tough, I survived it with a bit of therapy. Edit: Added TLDR",0

Tells us not to burden others with our problems. Demands we keep our pain in the shadows. But this is the nasty cycle that keeps us locked in to our loneliness. We feel lonely, hate that we feel lonely, feel stupid for looking weak, and decide to keep it hidden. We find worth in our connection to others. Not because they decide if we are worthy or not, but simply because our ability to contribute what is in us is only useful in light of others.

But when I began to open up to others and let them struggle with me and offer help. And by also helping others myself. It doesn't need to be family or current friends. Finding support is a hard thing these days. But there are great places now to get help working through the pain of living.",0

They are not terrible, can help in many people but take so long to be effective and are hit and miss so its a tough solution when in a present difficult crisis.

Obviously breaking interactions would just put on a facade, so she suggested breaking either thoughts by changing perception to be more of what she called rational, (through looking at the ups and downs of any situation instead of deciding based just on the downs) or breaking feelings by re-evaluating them using a similar method. &amp;nbsp; I've always unknowingly found myself back in the loop over and over again, but what I would do in your situation would be to look at things objectively, put a self-aware lens over your life, see what you can do to make it better and make choices from there.",0

Don't drink any more for now, maybe try and get some sleep or have a nice bath or shower or watch tv or something so you can calm down.  Please see a professional- a doctor or a therapist or something. Self harm is very serious. I have been doing it for many years, and it is a difficult addiction to break out of. If you feel the urge to cut again, take a deep breath, count to 10. Write your feelings down or draw them out, even if you don't think you're a great artist or whatever.

Born in a rich family, great social support with what she does, good education. She accepts that being an artist doesn't bring good money because interest and passion matter more. Still has been clinically depressed for years. Still making meager money. Every person I can think I'd back in college that studied fine arts or art history has rich families so they can continue to pursue a masters or phd in areas they like without worries. For those who don't have a privileged background, starving artists are no cliche - that's the norm. And I think people who are already depressed are unlikely to find poverty to be a good escape. Film - very unstable depending what you work on. Networking is extremely important and you must be socially savvy because it's all about power and money, even in independent films. This means competition and getting funding will be incredibly difficult. Therapists - you need good education and superb social skills and emotional control. A depressed person is unlikely to have the latter. All require years of training. Nurses - I don't need to elaborate more. Just google how many perfectly healthy, capable, and motivated nurses who still got burnt out and depressed. It's long work hours, high pressure and physically demanding to boot. What I want to say is this: any profession will have major shortcoming and sacrifices. There's no such thing as profession that are suitable for depressed people.

You must be going through so much with the world being unready to accept you yet. Just know there are people who do accept you for who you are. Whether it's the friend that lives far away from you or any person that read your post and identified with your story. You, staying alive and sharing this would also do wonders for trasgenders who have trouble being accepted by their families or close ones. Depression causes us to feel helpless and unloved.

7492,"What types of jobs are you applying for? I ask because every single job (since graduating college) I've ever had has been a job where the company required a degree, but the job itself didn't necessary need the skills provided by a degree. They used the degree as a way to weed people out. I have a BA as well, and student debt, but I don't feel like it wasn't worth anything. Even though I took a pay cut with my new job (for better benefits), my income is still more than the average income for a family where I live. I say this because, at this point, you can't change that you got a BA. You just gotta accept it and don't dwell on the I should have dones because if you do, you'll just fuck yourself over and the negativity will eat you alive. Now, you just gotta make a plan - what can you do with your degree? What are some skills you learned from your degree and previous jobs that can transfer over to something else? Is there anything at all you can cut from your budget? Get a roomie? Etc. Plans suck and when you're already depressed, the are the last things you want to be worried about, but it's hard to change things you don't like without one.

All you are seeing is what they want you to see: their happiness and confidence and success. What they hide are their fears, their worries, their guilt, and even their unrealistic dreams.

It often feels like we are just vehicles of pain who live so that others don't suffer from grief should we commit suicide.  As we develop a greater sensitivity to the cost of mental illness, policies and social norms will change: Some countries now allow for euthanasia for those with chronic and unbearable mental illness.  But what's strange about all of this is, even though I'm certain I have the right to kill myself because I'm miserable everyday, I am pulling for you to live, even though you're a stranger on the internet. I have hope for you and I don't even know you. I want you to wait it out, to battle it out, not because you owe me or anyone else, but because I think there might be something better for you in a day or a week or a decade from now.

7512,"what are you needing help with? part of the problem with anti depressents is how easily and flippantly they are prescribed. There is use for these medications but should be far more proper professional analysis before determining the correct meds, and monitoring. Lack of health care support means throwing the most widely used ones at a patient, refer a psych and hope for the best. They are not terrible, can help in many people but take so long to be effective and are hit and miss so its a tough solution when in a present difficult crisis. Sometimes doctors will prescribe short term assistance like Benzos and tranquilizers to keep stable in the short term, I found this works better for me than long term anti-depressents.",0

You learn to tolerate it better and manage your mood.  What do you think you need the most help with?,2

7548,"I think people are meant to regularly bathe. Like we have probably been bathing while still hairy and grunting. I wasn't raised the best; one thing is that I was never taught to bathe regularly. It was normal to bathe once every 2-4 weeks growing up. Basically, I never had it ingrained into me, which led to being super hygienic to the point of irritation and skin problems during puberty, and complete abandonment of hygiene during my intense depressive periods. So during these periods I would go as long as I could possibly can without showering until it was literally affecting everything I did, usually 4-6 weeks. My dirtiness would get into my eyes, and they would burn like hell. I got more skin problems from the build up of dead skin: in grown hairs, dry scaly skin, acne, etc. My hair had issues too: unhealthy and wiry possibly from an unhealthy scalp and follicles and dandruff. My dick had some infection and itched like hell. I also looked like shit too and was never prepared for events that forced me to go outside which made everything worse (I would hide and wait out people who potentially could see or interact with me, for example). I also was dirty and made my surroundings just as dirty, and I smelled bad, but luckily I don't have volatile BO. *Anyways*, just saying that there are some serious consequences to poor hygiene that I wish someone told me about.

You will never fuck on the first date, and sex is not the only thing that matters in life. Would you fuck a doll with no feelings? Always talk with girls with the mentality that you won't have sex with them. Gurls also feel love. 3- Keep living with your pillow.

Your mom and sibling would spend the rest of their lives wondering if it was something they did or said that pushed you over the edge, or thinking about what they could have done differently to be there for you. One of both of them would likely spiral into a depression of their own. I used to think that no one would miss me much if I killed myself, but always remember the sound of my brothers voice when he found me with blood pouring from my arm. That something that you can just get over. Even leaving notes really help the pain for your family. Also consider the suffering of the people who found you. It could be an RA or a dorm mate. They would be traumatized for life, with severe PTSD from seeing a dead, decomposing body. That point would be too late for you to do anything, so we try not to let it go that far. get me wrong, I know where coming from, and not trying to make you feel bad for would be wrong. And clear from the fact that even thinking about these things that you have some reservations, so build on that. Take every little good thing that happens to you and imagine never feeling that way again, and imagine robbing the people you love of those feelings as well. Forgive me for being brash, but there is absolutely nothing delicate or glorious about suicide. The people who experience it secondhand go through ten times the suffering of the people who commit it.

The thing that has been helping me lately, and what my pyschiatrist told me, was to get a hobby. I like to read a lot of japanese books so I picked up on the language so I could start reading them directly from Japan.

I do however think friends are important, although I have none in real life. If anyone at all tries to be your friend, I think you should try and be more open to making friends instead of like me.

7662,"That has to be tough.  It's different strokes for different folks of course but I might have a suggestion. I find my depression tends to be racing negative thoughts. My understanding is that there are two default brain modes, one is random thought, day dreaming for example, and the other is processing. So you need to switch from day dreaming to processing, and that is hard for everyone. Start with meditation. Close your eyes for 5min and focus on your breathing. If your thoughts drift from breathing, then shut it down n snap back to breathing. Don't get emotional, just stay calm and focus on breathing. When finished, move everything that is a distraction away from you. No phone, no internet if possible, just clear that shit away and start studying as if it is your breathing. This focus is just like a muscle and the more you flex the stronger it will become. Don't expect to focus for hours on end, but try to catch yourself when you drift and get back to that focus.  Also make studying fun, or less boring. Take notes, highlight pages, repeat the things you read. Most importantly, try telling a story with what you are learning. It's a strong method for memorization. People with ordinary memories use stories and codes to memorize full decks of cards in minutes. Good luck!",2

7680,"To answer your question, I'm actually feeling alright today. Had an existential crisis last night and probably would have ended up killing myself or at the very least cutting myself if it wasn't for my dog licking my hand as I layed in bed crying myself to sleep (she's NEVER an affectionate dog, it took me a minute to even realise that she was actually licking my hand and I wasn't imagining shit). Thanks, Charlie.  Anyways, for me depression is like absolute insanity. It's not just sadness or feeling like killing myself every other week. Just pure insanity. The best example I can give is probably two years ago, seventh grade. That was probably the lowest I had ever been. Every night when I went to sleep, I'd stay up on my phone. Not because I wanted to be, because it kept me from going to sleep and having the same nightmares I had every night. And then I'd look at the time, which by now was probably about 12 AM, realise how absolutely sad and pathetic I was and turn on some emo music, usually being something like Set it Off's I'll Sleep When I'm Dead and listen to that as I (literally) sadistically laugh and cry myself to sleep. Some nights, that kind of stuff never happened. I'd have a peaceful sleep. Some nights I'd stay up all night debating whether I should text the suicide hotline, doing so, and it being no help whatsoever.  So I'd get, maybe six hours of sleep at most. Before I'm woken up and have to get ready for school. How am I woken up? By my parents during the best part of my dream or the most peaceful part of my nightmare. Which already started my day off terribly. Then for an hour I'd be in the bathroom once again listening to emo music as I let the shower water run. My favourite songs to listen to were usually just about anything by Hollywood Undead. Not something a twelve year old should be listening to, sure. But it was a way to cope with my depression. As I listen to those songs, once again sadistically laughing at my own pain and often times end up cutting myself. I never cut myself deep, I was far to afraid of doing that. But... I enjoyed seeing the blood come out. I didn't cut for any sort of high or release of pain. It was sort of hard to explain. I was never addicted to cutting, I could stop or start whenever I wanted. Sometimes stopping for months at a time, but seeing the blood, made me feel happy. If you could have seen my eyes, especially when I cut myself, you wouldn't have seen any traces of a twelve year old. You'd see an insane person desperately trying to grasp on to the last straw of sanity, but nothing else. Some days I'd debate whether I should do a sort of murder-suicide thing. Or at the very least murder those who have caused me pain and suffering. Sometimes I'd have very and scarily elaborate plans on how I'd trick, kidnap, or kill my family. Things that you'd never expect from a twelve year old. But quite frankly, I might have physically been twelve, but my depression had probably aged and matured me way faster. The ride to school was probably the most traumatic for me. The ride was only about ten minutes (five minutes to school, five minutes in the carpool line). But those ten minutes were full of tests streaming down my face, me punching myself or ripping my hair out, or destroying my notebooks or pencils. Sometimes because I just really didn't want to go to school. Sometimes because my social anxiety got the best of me. Sometimes for reasons I don't even know. Me and my grandma would usually sit at the front of the school for about an hour or two, I'm sitting there trying to find a way to hurt myself because I'm angry, but don't want to let my anger out on her, and she's crying because she's absolutely lost on how to help me. I'd usually end up getting to school about a good three hours late.  In school, I don't remember anything. Maybe it's because I was just walking around the school like a robot. Class for an hour, find your next class, repeat. In class, I'd have my head down in a book (not paying attention to the teacher whatsoever), I'd be mindlessly reciting the emo songs I listen to in my head, or I'd be talking to my friend AIDEN. (Yes, his name is in all caps). What I do definitely remember is hating all of my peers. Hell, I still hate them. It's not my hatred for them itself. It's just I can't stand how immature, idiotic, and stupid they were. Like who the hell goes around sticking Tide pods in their mouths for views on social media? Or who thinks it's funny to go around telling people to kill themselves because you heard your favourite edgy YouTuber say it and now you think it's hilarious to do so. Or why do you think it's cool and okay to curse every five seconds and use the N-word? Or why do you think that because you saw Kim Kardashian half naked in some photo shoot that you can show up to school with hardly any clothes on or sag and talk about fucking whores because your favourite rapper said it in their newest song? Act your own god damn age, quit trying to act like someone three times your age while being as immature as a kindergartener.  More on AIDEN: AIDEN sort of just appeared out of nowhere. I don't know when or why I came up with him, I just sort of did. I'm not schizophrenic, he was 100% my own voice talking back to me in my head, but I enjoyed pretending to have someone to talk to. Someone who walked around with me everyday, knew exactly what I was thinking, and could relate to me all the time. Someone who (though was just my own voice), talked me out of suicide many times back in 7th grade. But slowly I started treating AIDEN a lot more like a real person. To the point where I could have easily been mistaken as someone with schizophrenia.  At home I'd just go into my room and basically lock myself in. My door was never locked, my parents could come in and out as they pleased, but I would just hand out under the covers all day. I didn't want to see light, light didn't want to see me. I didn't bother with homework. I figured, I fail, I fail. I really had just given up with life at that point. The only reason why I hadn't killed myself was probably because I was too sad and lazy to bother trying. Occasionally I'd talk to AIDEN or watch YouTube or something, but most times I ended up listening to hypnosis. Hypnosis for me was like a way to escape real life. Like meditation, but instead of being left alone with my sad and depressing thoughts, I could listen to someone else. At first it was a nice little escape, but then it more or less because an addiction. An odd strange one that I'd never be able to explain to anyone, but an addiction none the less. I'd try to listen to hypnosis any time I could even if that meant going into my room away from family to listen to it. It kind of gave me the same high that cutting, smoking, drugs, or porn give other people. Even though it was just hypnosis, it really did become unhealthy. Before I knew it, it was time for me to go to bed. And then the whole cycle would repeat itself over and over and over and over and over again. It was the same routine, same schedule, same insanity over and over again. This sounds like more is going on than just depression, right? Like some other underlying mental illness. But this is all depression and a bit of social anxiety. No MPD, no schizophrenia, no bipolar disorder, I'm not a psychopath or sociopath. This was all thanks to my depression.  No one actually knew how bad my mental state was. I never told anyone. I was diagnosed with depression and put on meds, but if anyone really knew how bad it was, I likely truly would have been put in a mental health hospital. This is where the most insane part was, since being on my meds, I'm a lot more stable. But I miss being the way I was. Even though they were supposed to, my meds didn't help my depression. It really just made me more stable. Now without AIDEN or cutting myself or the enjoyment of listening to emo music as I sadistically laugh and cry at the same time, I just feel empty. Though I was completely fucked up, it was still fun a times to laugh at how much I hate myself and my life. Now I can't do those things anymore.

There has to be something in your life, big or small, that makes you feel in a good way. For me I felt like I couldn't have any good emotions. Only bad ones. I sat down one day and really thought about my life. When I'm with my friends I usually can feel good. Most of all my little brothers are what bring me true joy and happiness. I took hold of this and I try to spend time with them the best I can, and sometimes I won't because I'm in a state of self pity, but I'll realize what I'm doing and pull myself out of my bed and spend some time with them. It always helps me. I understand how you feel, but there has to be at least one thing that makes you feel in a non hurtful way.

7697,"It's a sad reality that everything comes to an end and that we're not given an exact explanation of why we're here or what the meaning of it all is. The way I see it is that we're here to give our life meaning one way or another. Since we don't know the meaning we have to make the meaning. Some people find that through their work, family, helping others, etc. Life is full of endless possibilities of what we can do with it. It's hard getting to the point where we feel like we're happy or accomplished but that in itself is another aspect of life and finding meaning. For some people it could take most of their lives to find the meaning that they were looking for and in my view I'd rather spend my whole life looking for that meaning and helping who I can along the way than to just accept that there's no meaning to it and end it since that's not really an answer. I may never get the answer myself but I can at least enjoy the journey leading to the end and maybe that in and of itself was the meaning all along. You'll meet many varieties of people throughout your life who will give you different perspectives of what meaning is to them and maybe that will help you on your journey and maybe it won't. We have the time we're given and what we do with it is dependent on us. Even after we die and join the rest of the universe in it's infinite there'll still be people around who will say, Hey remember u/OkayScience, I want to do what he did and live my life to its fullest. We can still be remembered for the life we lived even after we're gone and in that way we'll essentially live forever. This is the way I see life and it helps me from time to time. I still have my bad days and sometimes consider if it's all worth it but then I just keep going because I won't know if I just stop here. Plus it helps talking to people about it at times and if you do feel like talking about it more feel free to send me a message. Keep going with the journey and stay strong since you'll find your meaning in time.",2
7698,"Well at least you still can hold on to that choice. Being terminally ill for the past 7 years (Im 42 now) the physical pain of a slow and horrible illness has led to my depression and desire to die. It is up to my wife though. And for her I live every day in hell. When you have even one person to keep you going, it can be enough. I am a lurker here and I read posts to give me perspective. Rarely can I physically reply. But what my experience being bound to a bed 24/7 has taught me is that once I made my peace with dying, I became indifferent to everything. For myself It's been tough to see people truly depressed to the point of wanting to die. I am very empathetic, but my depression is a symptom so its hard to understand. The one thing I do understand though is that the last thing you want to hear is Don't do it!!! Call this number... or other similar programmed/indoctrinated responses. So just know this... The world and life can be one big shitshow... So it helps to keep toilet paper handy. Let your friend be your toilet paper and be your friends toilet paper. It will be enough.  Lastly... Just remember that no matter how bad life feels (and is...) even I am artificially grateful for the fact that I have a far better life right now (suffering from *pain and bound to a bed), than 99.999999% of all humans to have ever lived. Just try to make it as long as you can. Know how much worse it can be. And let your toilet paper know that you need them to help clean up some shit. Then when you are ready to go.... You will know. But I cant see it happening for you as long as you remain attached to someone that you can call a friend. So give yourself a list of requirements that must be met for you to end it all. *- Pain so severe that causes me to vomit my own feces at times as it sends my body into shock. I wish you the best. I hope you can suffer less in time if possible. You and I are here right now... That makes us stronger than those who gave up yesterday. (And if you do one day come to the realization that you must go, make sure to do it in a way that allows your organs be given to help others. It helps me knowing that maybe I will have something that can give a healthy, long, and amazing life for a person who is still able to live it. ) Just think about making the list... And go tell your friend, right now, that you love him/her... Even if they are not quilted and only 1-ply thickness. You both need that right now... The whole world needs that right now.

7703,"it *probably* depends on the state (edit: what state in the US). being 14, you are going to be tethered to your parent/guardian legally. the therapist/counselor/psychologist will be legally required to tell your guardians of anything that serves of specific risk. for example, i told my therapist that i was suicidal and he had to contact my mother and explain the basics of the situation. for self harm, im not sure exactly how/if the information would be disclosed by the therapist/counselor/psychologist to your parents.. but im assuming if you are physically hurting yourself to a GREAT EXTENT then yes, it would most likely be disclosed.  im 18 now, and started seeing my on-campus(university) therapist and psychiatrist at the beginning of the school year, where i was 17. it sucks not being in control of your life, but what can you do, you know?  if getting to see a therapist is an issue, i would recommend asking to talk to your doctor/pediatrician in private (during a normal check-up) and say tht youve had symptoms of depression/anxiety and you'd like to have some help talking to your parent about getting help. if it's not an issue of talking to your parent/guardian, then what's the worry? if you cant see a doctor, a school counselor could help you have this conversation with your parent! or even a supportive teacher that you trust.  i went through a very similar situation when i was younger, and very much regret not being more persistent about getting help when i needed it. it mght not go away, and with school only getting harder and more stressful as you age, it's *really hard* to deal with all this emotional baggage. everyone deserves to feel the best that they can.  you dont want to suffer anymore and someday you wont! feel free to pm me, i'd be happy to be your pen-pal through all this &lt;3",2

7714,"Therapy: it works if you have a good therapist who helps you understand yourself; why you feel or don't feel certain things, ways you bring certain miseries upon yourself. Also if they are a champion for you. What I mean by that is they empathize with you rather than shoving psycho babble down your throat. They offer real tools for help. Also, you have to put in the work. Therapy doesn't fix anything. Just helps educate you on how to better handle yourself. Meds also work, but sometimes you have to try a few different kinds to find the best fit for you. They don't work overnight either; they can take upwards of 10-14 days in most cases before your brain starts to readjust. For me, I found my original dosage wasn't strong enough after a year or so and had to double up.",2

It's a daily nightmare. I would say that MAYBE, if I gave advice on it, it would be that I used to have a similar thing with shyness, and with that I pushed myself into more and more social situations and now am not so shy. It MAYBE might work the same way with liking/disliking social interaction. But I do that everyday and I still don't like people. I'm more COMFORTABLE around them, but I still don't LIKE them. And it's an entirely different ball park with depression/anxiety than shyness, otherwise if it were so easy to just 'force' yourself to socialize to fix the problem, I'd be doing it myself.

The risk and fear of losing the happiness, is part of how I feel good. Like, I feel proud that willing to take that risk. If that makes sense? Be careful with music, powerful.

Those who care enough to try and help fix me end up getting hurt, and in the end, I'm still just a vial of poison. All I'm capable of doing is hurting others. I'm guessing this type of mindset sorta leaked into everything I do, so I tell myself not only do they do not want to be with me, they are better off for it.",2
7790,"Yeah. I'm afraid of a painful death. I'm afraid of dying itself. Does my consiousness just stop? Does it feel like before I was born? Is there something afterward? Both heaven and hell sound terrible. I don't want to stop having my body, it's like my home. But then at the same time I hate it here. Daily conversations are robotic and empty. People are rude and selfish. Everyone is obsessed with fast cars and big houses and parties... but none of it means anything. I'm just so tired.

It's really fucking difficult to wear a mask all the time, but at least it's marginally better that being alone all the time, isn't it? Most people don't want to associate with someone who is severely depressed and deathly anxious, and I can't even blame them.. If I do act like how I feel, I'm probably a nightmare to be around, because there's an aura of sadness and hopelessness that surrounds me. How can I expect anyone to approach me? Even if there is someone who does, it would be crazy to expect them to completely accept a miserable wreck like me. I mean, I can't just take and not give.. And then there's the people who act all smug and give you all that fucking moronic rose-tinted glasses shit with an air of superiority, a la /r/wowthanksimcured, and you feel even worse. It does feel like shit, but I've managed to construct separate personalities for interacting with my family and for anything job-related, because at a workplace, nobody gives a fuck if you're rotting on the inside due to over a decade of depression, anxiety, and self-hatred. So, while I wish I could agree with what you say, it's just not applicable..",2

You tell them to drink water, get plenty of rest, don't overexert, and eat bland foods. Drink tea, medicine, whatever. This is recommended for the most rapid recovery.  If they neglect this advice, they run the risk of getting sicker.  What do you tell someone who is sick with depression?  Just do your best to keep up with life. Make sure you eat, make sure you sleep, brush your teeth, do whatever chores you would normally do, try not to turn to any vice or addiction, and avoid isolating yourself. If you upkeep with life, you are more likely to see a faster recovery.  If you fail to upkeep, you run the risk of digging a hole and becoming more depressed.  You are strong, and you got this.

7817,"omg lol I 100% blame my parents. After taking an AP Psychology course at my school, it kind of shifted my own perspective on my depression. I know I can't claim to be an expert after reading just one textbook, but even an idiot can realize that your behavior and who you are is just totally as a result of your parents. The genetic aspects aren't their fault of course, but they are perfect human specimens, so you can imagine what 17 years of always being wrong has done to my self esteem and thought process. Strangely, being cognizant of that fact doesn't change it much. Of course, I've directly told my parents I blame them for who I am, and as perfect specimens, they told me that I can't keep blaming them for everything. There's truth to that of course, but it's rather incredible that they can find the gall to abdicate themselves of all guilt and responsibility. I'd better just get on my hands and knees and obey their every whim, since they're the ones who work and pay for my existence, regardless of whether or not I can actually do jack shit about that (child labor laws, yo).

If you are feeling this low in your life that you want to die nothing I nor anyone else can say to change your mind but I will try my best to do what I can. There are people around you who can help you. Hospitals, doctors, therapist and counsellors. Over 20% of the worlds population deal with mental illness and seeing another person give in would be heartbreaking. Sadness is a passing feeling but depression is long term however it is recoverable. Things might be horrible right now but I promise you if you reach out and get help you can do this. You can get pass this difficult stage and these feelings will eventually leave. But perhaps you've already tried to get help and it hasn't worked. If so, thats ok. Therapy doesn't work for everyone but we can find a way to help you get out of this state so please before picking up that gun think of everything you will be leaving behind. Right now it may feel like you're alone and no one cares, but you won't know what truly will happen if you're dead. You won't be able to see people you love anymore, hear sounds of music or voices, see colours and people around you. A life you could have lived. You will be in an internal slumber, this is not a temporary way of dealing with this so please think this over. You can message me.

7850,"quite a few things ive noticed for myself. ill over simplify my thought process to get the point across. Ill list them quickly.  I thought that if I could go through physical pain, then I can go through mental pain. A physical scar is easier to understand that an emotional one. Having to tend to my wounds to stop the bleeding and cover them up distracted me from what I really wanted to tend to and cover up. There was a couple times where I self harmed because my thoughts were too overwhelming while I was trying to fall asleep. Afterwards, I would spend some time in the bathroom alone, taking care of my bleeding and by the time it was all finished, I forgot what I was thinking about. Self harm was an effort to try and beat life at its own game. If life was beating me up, maybe if I did a better job at that than life then maybe the punches life throws at me seem so bad. since moved on from this.

I tried to think of them as living proof that Depression (personified for metaphor) was wrong about me. It told me nobody cares, nothing matters, if you died nothing would change. I showed it my mother and sister, and told it even if you see no value in me, others do.  Basically, in my mind, I used my family as a logical check against the lies.

Though I don't think I could enjoy it due to the ever present risk of STI's and unwanted pregnancies and even vasectomies don't technically 100% alleviate that risk. I don't think it would be really all as great as it gets built up in my mind to be. I think the biggest thing is the difficulty building up and sustaining interest in things to distract myself with.

7932,"Well, is moved into a new home a few months ago, befor that i always had to walk 30 - 60 minutes to get where ever i had to go (sschool, work, train station and so on). Everyone was always so confused why i liked to walk the whole way, even if someone would offer me to drive to work,s chool, or back home again. I just liked to put my headphones on, listen to music, and let my thoughts just flow. I HAD to go from A to B, so i wouldn't worry about something i still have to do, because i could do nothing while i had to walk from A to B. I could just disconnect from my life for a while. And it always felt great. Dont get me wrong, all the bad thoughts, the bad emotions and feelings weren't gone, but it was just different, in a beautiful way.

If they dont understand it they wont know how to help,0
7935,"Okay, so feeling shitty is necessarily a shitty feeling. But, even subconscious you is empathetic and cares about others, which is a beautiful fuckin' thing to be. It's why you have the capacity to feel so bad, and it's also why you can (if you want to) be an amazing resource for people. Being able to feel things as deeply as you or I can is something to be cherished and protected and put to good use. The world could use more empathy, you know? It's okay to hate yourself too, btw. Just be honest with yourself about your good traits as well, yeah? &lt;3",0
7936,"This is how I look at it. Someone who is truly amazing in your life will change you into a new you. If that someone leaves you life somehow, you are still the new you. You still have a little bit of that someone inside of you. Once you die, that little bit of them dies inside of you as well. Do you respect those people who changed you in your life? Do you respect them enough to keep them with you? Those are the thoughts I think when I am ready to end it. Hopefully it helps you, friend.",2
7937,"Maybe you could break the routine somehow, like change your study space? Go to a cafe or the library or stay in your dorm (if you're in college)?

I've been in your place, completely cynical and want nothing to do with the way that society feels we should be. The truth is, you can find comfort in being yourself and falling into where you should be. Dreams of things exist because people see the start of something and then only the end of it (being famous, having lost all that weight etc...).

I've seen this too many times, where people spend days after days trying to find the one. That just now how it works. Although it is true that if you don't look, you won't find in most cases. You shouldn't fear not finding love. 'Cause that's just not how it works. I wouldn't say love finds you either, that's also not how it works. I wouldn't ponder too much about not finding the one or love. Time will tell, it will come. During that time, try to be alright with yourself by being just yourself. You want to be with someone because you want to be with them, not because you fear being lonely. Give it time. Talk to your friends. Enjoy yourself.",2

So to unravel these symptoms is to only go in reverse, by finding ways to constructively de-stress.",0
7967,"I'm game and need to vent so here goes...  I was verbally, physically and emotionally abused for as long as I can recall. Since you asked about emotional abuse I will focus solely on that.  I was blamed constantly for everything that was wrong with the family. My mother told me this numerous times after she and my father would have huge, physically violent fights that started over events that had nothing to do with me.  I was constantly told If you had a brain you would be dangerous. by my mother. Not after I'd done anything, not after a stupid act or action on my part but just in passing. This was my mother's assesment of me and she told me this frequently.  I was tested, determined to have a high IQ, placed in gifted and talented classes and made to suffer for it by narcissistic, superficial, egotistical mother for my entire life. If I vot an A I was told it was because the work was too easy for me, if I got a B it was because I was lazy and never applied myself. I would constantly be accused of thinking I was So smart.  Nothing I ever did or attempted to do was good enough, there was always some flaw in it. I only received criticism, never any praise.  In 4th grade I had lovely long hair, my mother decided I should have it all cut off. She took me to a beauty school and had them cut all of my hair off, a boy cut, they shaved the back of my neck. My mom cried afterward and said she was crying because The haircut showed how ugly I was. The next week we were going into our small town to pick up this giant fancy framed picture for our living room, My mom made me walk on the opposite side of the street after we got out of the car. She said, I don't want to be seen with you and have people know you are my daughter. My mother really values externak beauty. I was a skinny unremarlable child, I never forgot the other side of the street incident, I had to look at the damn framed picture that we picked up that day until I moved away from home and got married at age 19. Every time I saw it I thought of that day. Years of torture.  I was a divorced single mother, my ex never paid a dime, not any of the support we were supposed to receive. I worked two jobs to support us. I never received any financial help from anyone. I crafted a nice career for myself and tried to be a good mom and a good person. I never drank, never did drugs or ran around or went wild or got in any trouble. But my mother was/is ashamed of me and made/makes sure to let me know it. Anyone she talks about to me she lets me know how successful their children are, how wealthy they are and how proud the parents are.  My mom told me one day how disappointed she was with how I'd turned out, how she always thought I'd be someone when I grew up. She said she'd hoped I would've grown up to marry a doctor or lawyer or someone important.  I told her I was someone. At the time I was an online database adminstrator with a nationally recognized nonprofit but to my mother I was an embarrassment, a nothing and a nobody.  My mother's father, my grandfather was one of the only people in my life that was always kind to me, he treated me like I was special and had value. My mother knew I adored him and she hated that he liked me. After he died she insisted on telling me horrible things about him saying she wanted me to know what kind of man the grandfather I worshipped really was and that I should not feel special that some thing like him tolerated me better than most.  Right after I was divorced, I was not yet employed full time and very poor. I was visifing my parents at their huge house in the country. My mother started bitching about how poor I was, I had not asked her or dad for a dime and I was not there to eat. Mom started talking about dying, asked me if I had a sill, etc.. Mom told me I better not die because she did not want to have to spend her money on a funeral for me, and she said not that anyone would show up at a funeral for me anyway. She also told me that she'd always thought of me as a living abortion, since my birth. She was going nuts, yelling and spitting. She told me she bet I was so poor, such a failure that I probably could not even afford feminine products. I got my purse to leave, opened it and hurled a few tampons at her, as I told her, wrong bitch. My father blocked the front door, and tried to make me apologise to my mother. I had to threaten to call the police before he would let me go.  After my father passed away my mother called, she said she needed to ask me something. Then mom said, Did you ever think or get the feeling that your father really loved you or cared about you? I told my mom that yes, yes I did. That dad was a fifties guy and although he may not have ever been emotionally demonstrative I thought he did love and care about me. He has worked hard and made personal sacrifices to care for us financially when I was young. That there had been a few occassions that he'd been very nice to me. Like going into a shop and buying me a top he knew I wanted for my 16th Birthday. Buying me a computer, working with me on computer projects early on, buying us both laptops, teaching me to shoot and fish, and by his having special nicknames and greetings for me, etc.. I told mom that was how dad expressed his love. My mother said, That's interesting because I always had the impression that he didn't care about you at all.  I was also emotionally abused by my father, it was different than my mother's abuse though. My dad alwsys had to be the best. He could not stand for me to be good at anything I could never, ever be as good as he was or (god fobid it) better. My parents were never involved in our education. They basically just asked us at dinner how school was and we'd say OK and dinner would proceed.  I should have known from past events not to dare say anything positive had happened but one day I was happy and excited about something that had happened at school, in English class. I was so excited that I stupidly spoke up at dinner. When the standard, How was school? question was asked I boldly said, School was great, Mrs. G, my English teacher pulled me aside after class. She told me a poem I'd written for an assignment was so good they want my permission to publish it on the first page of the student yearbook! My father put his fork down, he tilted his head, gave me a bizarre look and told me to recite the poem. I could not recite it, I was too nervous and afraid. I said I would show it to him after dinner, it was no big deal. No, dad wanted to hear this fabulous poem I had written, right then. I went and got the poem and started to read it out loud. Dad told me to give it to him to read. He told me if it was in the yearbook people woukd be reading it for themselves. Dad read it silently and then while scoffing and half laughing he read it aloud.  Dad asked me if the idiots at my school really thought that was good writing? He said he bet he could write something right then that would be a hundred times better. Dad left the table and went to his desk while we all sat at the table waiting for his return. After about twenty minutes Dad cheerfully returned, poem in hand. He stood and read it to us. It was some lame poem with Brother can you spare me a dime as one of the lines. Dad then told us, See, that's a poem, that's what good poetry is like! After that he asked all of us, Wasn't my poem better, a lot better? We all agreed, and lied and said his poem was a lot better.  I told the English teacher not to let them use my poem for the yearbook. I never wrote another poem or much else for that matter. That crap happened in 1975 and I am still not over it despite counseling.  Another thing that was a form of emotional abuse was the family hierarchy. My father came first, then my sister or mother, then me. I.always came last, even though I was the eldest child. There was this thing with the food. If we had any serving size type of meat it came into play. Let's say it is steaks for dinner, they are on a platter. The largest steak is for Dad, younger sister gets the next largest, mom third largest and smallest was for me.  It was like that with all of the food. It was an unwritten rule. I decided to challenge it once when the platter of Hamburgers was beside me. I knew better than to go for the one for Dad but tried to take the secind largest one. My mom was immediately shrieking at me, No, no, put that back, it's for your sister! Yours is the small one.  My parents home has our family pictures hanging in the study, they are hung vertically on one wall. The order is from top to bottom, a picture of my dad, a picture of my mom, a picture of my sister, a picture of my son, then a picture of me. I.am at the very bottom, like always.  I.endured physical, emotional and mental abuse. I've seen therapist on occasion over the years and at one point was in therapy sessions twice a week for a year. It helped but it hasn't enabled me forget. I just have to deal with what happened and move forward. I'm not social, I don't really trust anyone or have any close friends but I'm okay with that.  TLDR: Emotionally abused, made me tough, I survived it with a bit of therapy.  Edit: Added TLDR",2

Having trouble in the subway? Well, you can pull the breaks anytime. That's pretty expensive and affects a lot of people but just knowing that I could is a big plus. I am not a prisoner in these situations. I am free. I can leave whenever I want. But sometimes I realize I panic because of no logical reason. I tell that myself.

For example I could barely get out of bed this morning to go to work but even though I'm here hating it I would alternatively be at home sleeping until 2pm then lay in bed on my phone all day.,2

Like, yes, thanks very much Captain Obvious, everything is relative, but that's beside the point?  It's invalidating, insensitive and snobby, at best, and I have no idea if it helps you feel any better, but when a lot of people say it, they do think they're doing some genuine good to help you feel better, despite being wildly misinformed on how hurtful that phrase actually is. My boyfriend said this to me more frequently in the past and after YEARS of explaining why this is not a good response, he's slowly using it less, but when it pops up, my typical counter is That does not help me/make me feel better at all, and that typically shuts him up or at least makes him think about what he just said.

About 3/4's of that bottle later, I was in such pain that I couldn't help but to tell my wife. (She knew I had problems but not to what extent.) I went to bed that night praying to God for death. Wishing so bad to die in my sleep. I wanted it so bad. I look back on that time in my life as the breaking point. The point in which I decided I was meant for more than this.

8025,"an enhancer of mood. The danger of drinking goes like this: Alcohol makes you numb. While also making your focus more on certain things. So, if you are angry and you drink, you might start to feel less angry. This because alcohol is making the problems go away, just becoming less conscious. The common thing that happens is we trick ourselves into thinking alcohol = less The reality is that there is less of anything. There is less pain, but there is less joy, jealousy, curiosity, on the spectrum of sobriety, stone sober is at one side and unconscious is on the other side. In other words, the more you drink, the close you move to passing out...which explains why you feel less the more you drink. This seems like not the worst thing in the word. But the problem lies in revisiting sobriety (which is why I call it an if The feelings return and feel stronger than before. This is often what promotes alcoholism. a perpetual escape from returning return of feeling. This is not to demonize alcohol. Like I said, all about how used. Since, underage, I recommend it.

I think the key is to accept whatever you are feeling, not fight it and not try to change it, even try to get yourself to cry. The point is really to change your mindset from 'i have depression i can't cure it, it is killing me' to 'i'm sad again for no reason, human brain is a pile of shit and buggy as hell, I'm gonny cry all day to give it what it wants'..",2
8029,"Pretending to be happy can be extremely hard, no matter if depressed or not. Sure, depression doesn't make it any easier, thats a fact.  Do you have someone you can talk to? For example have a really deep conversation, tell them about your biggest fears? Where you dont have to pretend to be happy?  Wearing a mask is exhausting as hell, and the longer you try to keep it up, the more explosive will it be, when you can't hold it up any longer. In that regard, I speak from experience.  And last but not least, it's completely fine to not feel happy sometimes. You just have to feel sad, out of the loop, neglected, rejected or even hated sometimes. Those are the moments where you really analyze yourself and your doings, (something you should keep under control, because too much of it is destructive), and if you embrace it, roll with it, telling yourself that this is natural and just a response of something inside you, you can't really pinpoint yet, those times could actually end up being beneficial for you.

Might try again later.  Valerian root: Calms some people down. Doesn't do much for me.  Rhodiola Rosea: Apparently gives you more energy while keeping you calm. Maybe a bit more energy for me but could be placebo effect.  St. John's Wart: Supposed to be a natural antidepressant. I am thinking of trying it soon.  Magnesium: Helps some people (assuming deficiency exists) but I have not tried it yet.  Alcohol: Works great to calm social anxiety in a moment! Don't consume if taking prescription drugs. Consume in moderation if you need to drive home.  Marijuana: Can really elevate mood, depends on the person. Can be combined with alcohol for added effect. Don't drive at all after using it. Don't use if illegal where you live or your employer drug tests.  ---  Lifestyle:  ---  Exercise: Some people rave that being active reduces anxiety and depression. In my case the gym is actually a trigger. I do enjoy going for a walk on a nice day though.  Diet: I have started eating better and less. I have lost substantial weight and feel physically better. The sense of accomplishment and feeling better about my body has probably helped my depression.  Travel: If you can afford it take a vacation and go see the world.

If you can't rely on that, you are fucked. If you suddenly can't feel some emotions anymore, you're fucked. If you no longer feel the moral qualms that have guided you for years, you're fucked. Please tell me what is worse than only being able to use a computer to interact with your environment and that computer being broken in a way we don't understand? Just that it is worse than that, because there is no you. You are the computer and your network card is fried, your CPU has a tear and your battery no longer holds charge...and there's nothing that can be done. All you can do is grit your teeth and keep going. Try to adjust to the fact your version of reality is not actually real and that information you are getting about your body is downright not true - apart from when it is, because if your brain believes you have no energy, you sure as fuck have no energy. Try to not let the lack of love and happiness and the very concept of hope throw you into that pit of despair. Now, pray tell me, what precisely could be worse? I'd rather be hungry with a broken arm, because then I would still know that it is me who is hungry and that my arm hurts. I could still believe that may be tomorrow there will be food.

Take some time out and just breathe and let the shit go...you got this. you are right now...literally and I want to fall into those emotions and spread the way I feel everywhere. I want those who love me to know and those who hate me to know more but in the f u kinda way. But we because we have been here before and got through it-and we were happy again-and bam we are here now. But we will be happy again. You know what would make me happy right buffalo wings lol...like for real. That is the break through-realizing that it fucking sucks sometimes. So what, supposed too...because that is what makes buffalo wings sooo much better hahahaha. I hope you feel better all I wish for you!!!",2
8092,What is going on? How long have you been thinking about this? Maybe we should talk about it first and think through some stuff...,2
8093,"you are not, stay positive, look ahead",2
8094,"It helped at the beginning of my marijuana usage when I was smoking maybe 2-3 times a week but if it can spiral out of control pretty quickly to where it creates a vicious cycle of abuse. The marijuana also blew my anxiety through the roof. In my experience, the depression will come back once not high (and sometimes even worse than it was before getting high) which has the potential for psychological dependence. Within 9 months of beginning self medication I went from smoking like $10 worth 2-3 times a week to 2-3 times a day so beware. By the end of the 9 month period I was spending about $200 a week on weed. Would possibly recommend but i think the best idea for those with addictive/binging personalities because you could end up seriously abusing it during massive depressive episodes.",2
8095,"Good luck friend I wish you the best. There have been multiple times where I wondered if this was a good idea for me, but I have 3 pets at home so it could never be an option unless I were married or something. Lol. Anyway, know you are brave and I am so proud of you for taking initiative to help yourself. You deserve to get better and I believe in you!",2

8098,"The biggest thing that has helped me is running. It sucks and I never have the motivation to do it, but I force myself to anyways. I feel a short term glow of relief after running about 2 miles. Being conscious of your thoughts and trying to interrupt negative thinking can help a lot too. The summary of what my therapist had taught me is this:  Your thoughts become feelings, your feelings become attitudes, and your attitudes become behavior. You cant change any of these other than your thoughts. If you can change your thoughts, you can change the others.",2

8106,"Depends what you mean by get caught. Someone would have to report it to police to move you anywhere or if you're under 18 parents can take you to a hospital. Basic detainment is 72 hours (3 days) To ensure you're not a harm to yourself or others. During that time they examine you and see your mental state. If at the end you're not showing signs of danger you are released but given options to stay for further treatment. If you are still a danger you stay and get more treatment. Now say you made an attempt and go to the ER for something, they can't always just detain you. I've been to the ER for atempt of suicide by oversosing on medication. Longest I was there was a few hours. Due to my mental state being stable they had no legal way to hold me loner than I wanted to be there. I got the drugs out of my system then was discharged and went home. There is a ton, a shit ton of misinformation and propaganda around mental illness. Be informed, do real research. isn't google. You are smart enough to do real research don't just ask strangers online for all the answers. Also get help.",0
8107,"I've smoked pot about 7 times or so. First time freaked me out, made me a little paranoid. I kept trying it in small doses and never really made me feel nice, just kinda paranoid. The very last time I took it I was with 2 friends and I took like 1 big-ish hit and became paranoid, again. Unfortunately, I spent that night freaking out over my heart racing and thinking I was going to have a heart attack. This ended up developing into chronic heart anxiety. This was about 4 or so years ago and now I live with extremely, extremely bad anxiety. I thought it'd be nice using it as an escape for my depression back then but never made me feel nice, alcohol did weirdly. I would love to try weed again in a different environment to see if it would help with my depression/anxiety. I hate taking heavy meds, I would much rather use weed.",2

8109,"I self harm, but Its not something I would ever suggest. It helps at first but eventually you just have two problems instead of one.  I try to rest more and drink lots of water, that seems to help. If you can, try to see a doctor. Depression can be a symptom of something else, especially with those other symptoms.",2
8110,so sorry that you are going through this as well. Is there anyone you might be able to talk with? I know waking up in the morning with thoughts of suicide can just ruin a day. Maybe if able you can try to do something fun or relaxing when you get home. I know it probably help right now but maybe it can help ease the thoughts for a bit. I wish I knew something that you could do while at work but I sorry. If you want to talk feel free to pm me. also at work with the same thoughts.,2
8111,What's been bothering you lately that you wish to escape?,2
8112,I feel like I'm walking in a pile of knee high mud,0
8113,in what way do people bother you. Like they personally go out of their way or you mean like everyone including random people annoy you?,2
8114,What do you think? What are three major pros and cons of each for you?,2
8115,"There's absolutely no point. But that's beauty of it. You get to choose everything. Do whatever the fuck you want. Do I feel like rolling out of bed today? Maybe I can sleep in all day? Or I can slowly inch out? You have the strength to do anything but it takes time depending on how much of a deviation it is from your normalcy. It's obviously not going to come at all once. So take baby steps, and that applies to everything. Because once you get going...Objects in motion remain in motion unless acted upon by an external force. So make Monday your bitch. Fuck, make it a damn Saturday. The point is, you don't have to follow along by the universe's plan. If you don't want to, then don't do it. But all it takes is a single *want* to leave your bed. And that'll come eventually, so why delay it? You're not going to hide in your covers forever are you? Or is today the day you whip the universe into submission by just **thinking** about it?",2
8116,Write here one good memory of something nice happened recently.,0
8117,Every day my friend...every day,2
8118,"do you have any close friends? every friend i get i tell them they'll just leave me like everyone else and they do, because i'm just so overbearing to everyone i talk to. does it help you to at least talk about it? even for a bit i feel that talking about it helps, but i never find anyone to talk to because all i do is just talk about depressing things a lot, i hate myself cause of it and in the end i just hate myself more and more.",0
8119,The mind replays what the heart can't delete.,0
8120,"It's fucking weird.  I often have to bring every ounce of willpower up to bring myself to go to a party with frends, even though I know it will be good.  But once I'm there, I'm often the Life of the Party, or so I think. I had people coming up to me, greeting me by my name and telling me how much fun they had last time we had met each other. Which was a year ago. For the first and last time since. I barely remembered their faces and not a single name. So I guess I left an impression.  I really like to banter, to do play on words and take words from their mouth and turn them around in a fun way. I joke and tell stories with expressive facial expressions and big gestures. I'm sarcastic, sometimes even cynical. And I joke a lot about myself, mostly in a non-flattering way.  I think people like me in general, I seldomly had someone outright refuse to interact with me.  But on the other hand, as soon as I come home, I feel a crushing void and I feel alone and that everything is pointless. Those feelings remain in my day-to-day life. And it starts to interfere with my work, for example. I am not one to contain my feelings in an enviroment where I spend most of my days and life in. My boss already told me once, in a pretty long phase of being really depressed, that even my collegues said that something must be seriously wrong and the have no fun working around and with me if I'm in such mood.  I can be fun at work, too. I made my co-workers laugh on a lot f different occasions. But that happens in good phases. But there are very bad phases where I, at best, don't say a single word all day unless absolutly necessary and at worst, I am filled with rage the whole day and can't contain it.  Last week I was as close to quitting my job as I was never before. Maybe it would be best for all.   Whatever, long story short:  I think I can be really funny, too. Despite the fact I feel fucking miserable inside or do not feel anything at all.",2
8121,What makes you happy now? Or at least what distracts you from how much you hate yourself? (Sometimes that's as close to happiness as I can get),2
8122,"If you quit now, you rob yourself of any chance for life to ever get better.",0
8123,Maybe because the devil you know is better then the one you dont. I would say maybe you're afraid of what may happen... so much that you would rather endure what you have rather than gamble.  Any of this sound right?  What bad situation are you in? Would you like to talk? I'm here if you do :) pm or reply on here :),2
8124,how deep does the rabbit hole go?,2
8125,Me too..depression clouds our judgment. It gets really hard to think about things clearly. Hate this feeling but it won't go away yet.,2
8126,"I think everyone's life is shitty, we're just the ones who are aware of and can't stop obsessing over it.",0
8127,"Maybe think about the things you like or enjoy, and try to find online forums that deal with those topics. Maybe there's a video game you really dig? Or a character from a movie or something like that? That can be a way to find common ground and connect with other people.",0

8129,"As a kid there was a brief window of time where I wasn't being bullied as much as I used to, and I had a personality. I made up jokes on the spot, would talk to anyone, was interested in loads of things.  Then, something happened and I seemed to just switch off again. It might've been all the rumours that I'd be beaten up by gangs of people every single day in the next school, because I didn't act a certain way. It might've been the continued bullying in that school. Soon enough I was a completely hollow shell once again.",2
8130,Im always here for you,0

8132,Maybe that is why we all are naturally depressed,0
8133,"I personally haven't, but from what I've read online a great deal of people don't regret it, they only feel shame because they failed and already plan their next attempt.

I literally am having daily breakdowns because of school right now and honestly I won't make it through this year. The thing is, summer can maybe make you think straight and give you energies to start again, I was trying to say that. Maybe they don't change and stay depressed all summer, but they could try at least. Summer is free time, always. Letting your mind rest is good, even if you don't do a thing.",2

8144,Have you tried admitting yourself anywhere?,0
8145,"They probably already know that cutting yourself good. People who self harm probably hear that often including myself. As much as you know logically that cutting good, sometimes you help it if it means that tiny bit of relief. Try suggesting alternative methods instead and asking why they cut. Is it the pain or is it seeing blood? If pain, tightly holding cold ice can be an alternative. There is pain but no damage. If blood, instead of cutting, trying using a red marker to mark themself instead. Talk through everything step by step and find possible solutions or alternatives at each step.",2
8146,"Do you mean your bad days feel worse or do you mean you feel bad and good at the same time?  Ever since this thing started for me I had fluctuations over the course of the day, days and weeks, where I would have lethargy, tiredness and depression in the mornings for example and then good feelings and even excitement and a lot of energy in the evenings. Also I have very good days/ weeks and suddenly it hits me again.  Did you have constant depression and how bad was it?",2
8147,You have a long shower to on bad days. My mind always starts thinking a bunch of things too.,2
8148,Yes! Dating can get you out of depression. Not without medical attention though. I'd tell from the get go,2
8149,"Hey, just wait it out. I know what you feel. Sometimes I think I'm attractive, and sometimes I can't even look at myself I'm so disgusted. I've come to realize it's all just a fucked up mind game I play with myself. I doubt you're actually that ugly, you're probably kinda cute honestly, but if you're anything like me, you've tricked yourself into thinking you're ugly.  If you want people to want to be around you, you have to do some basic things like showering, putting on actual clothes, smiling, excercising a little and pretending you have confidence. It's honestly dumb, but these things can be hard to do, especially if you struggle with low confidence and depression. But if you take care of yourself, it's not too hard to find people. And just you wait until you find a person to kiss on New Years, because the feeling is worth the wait.  I know this is all a bit corny, but if you ever wanna talk about anything I'd be more than happy to :)",2
8150,"You realize what s wrong. There's many things wrong and even though you're depressed you are comfortable in some way. Because realizing you must change your ways, can put some one in a discomfort zone. Truth is, you have to leave your comfort zones behind sometime in order to work on your happiness.  An example Some one who is desperately trying to lose wieght will put himself ahead with a struggle to his mind and body, but he knows that the outcome is what matters. He has to deal with discomfort to loose his wieght. There's no other way, that's just how life is. A surgery to lose wieght would be a pass.  There's no free passes or shortcuts in life and many learn the hard way.",0

8152,"That whole best years of your life thing, at least in my opinion, is a load of hogwash. Best years? Body going through changes? Trying to figure out your first relationships? Stuck in school all day? Drama everywhere? Restricted in everything you want to do? Inexperienced enough to not know what you really want to do? I could go on... HS sucks. With very few exceptions, the only people I know who consider HS the best years are people who are completely and totally miserable adults who are looking back with rose-colored glasses at a time when their parents paid for everything. College is better for most people, but the partying and crap is highly overrated once you're old enough to look back a bit. I don't know anyone who misses that stuff. But what are the best years? I think once you hit your mid-20s things really start to look up. Odds are, your career is at least starting to actually materialize, you aren't as emotionally immature anymore and things don't bother you like they used to, and generally speaking the odds are that things are more stable overall. Don't sell your future short--you'll look back and realize there's a lot of crap in HS/college that you'll be glad to have behind you!!",2

I like to start small, take control of whatever I can. Control is empowering. It could be a simple as just playing the shit out of a stupid flash game, or clearing out all the spam in your email, or reorganising your room. Just find something to keep yourself moving. Writing can help too, just lay it all out there. Seeing your words outside your head can help break the downward spiral of thinking. If it's worse now then that means was better, and it will be eventually. Think of someone you can talk to, who knows you well, and just hit them up and say hi. Maybe a text, maybe an email, just remind yourself that you are not alone.  It's a shitty battle but stick it out if you can. If you have a therapist try reaching out to one, and if you don't then see if you can get a friend or a parent to help you find one. There's nothing magic about professional help, but it does work sometimes and that's reason enough to get the process rolling if you feel like you can.

Not drinking is one the better things I've done in my life, and the benefits seem to compound the longer you go. My brain seems to work considerably more efficiently, and I continue to feel and overwhelming sense of clarity that wasn't present when I drank.

Odds are, your career is at least starting to actually materialize, you aren't as emotionally immature anymore and things don't bother you like they used to, and generally speaking the odds are that things are more stable overall.  Don't sell your future short--you'll look back and realize there's a lot of crap in HS/college that you'll be glad to have behind you!!",0

Spinach is a good choice because it's pretty nutrient dense as opposed to lettuce, and it's easy to add to stuff. You can even grab a can on minestrone (or any other type) soup, heat it up and dump a bunch of spinach into it to boost the vegetable content.  My go to recently has been a spinach salad with goat cheese and balsamic vinaigrette dressing. Maybe some day I'll get fancy and add onions or peppers or whatever to make it a real salad, but at this point, it's better than the grilled cheese by itself or whatever else I'm eating.

8208,"Hi there, you know that is a very good question and I used to have similar thoughts as you. I now have a question to ask you, why would other be happy with you when you are not happy with yourself? The thing is, we need to develop self love and self care first. Because without it, we will be too dependent on others and that becomes burdensome because no one's life is perfect and they all have their own issues to deal with. Even though other people wants to love you and support you, they can only do it to a certain extent. The rest of the void that you have inside of you can only be filled by yourself. I know you don't feel it but being able to learn to self love is the key to happiness because that is when you feel like your life is in your control again, not on others. I would recommend you to google how to self love or seek therapy to talk this over and find out what your root cause is. There is always help and a better life when you decide to become better and healthier. I speak from experience. You will get better, believe in yourself.",2

The experience I felt was pure happiness and no joking the last time I felt this was when I was a child happy and alive. I noticed what is good and bad in my life, and realized the blessing that I did not notice. It gave me positive momentum even after the trip. Now I am trying to finish my studies and now started seriously training in thai boxing. Recently my psychologist told me that my depression is gone (I can feel the difference) and my anxiety and stress remains high. I made big progress and I am going to make more progress.

You yourself have control of your own life and what you do with it. All I can say is that you might be making a really regrettable decision as you only have one life to live and enjoy to a degree. You only get one chance to feel anything if nothing and that is more than an incentive for most to keep going.,0

I also have anxiety, so this may play a role as well, but nearly every situation I can think of is tarnished by this overwhelming feeling of something being wrong. You feel out of place all the time and disconnected, like you're missing out on something everyone else is getting. And for me, I have no idea what is wrong, since it's impossible to pinpoint what isn't there. Thus, since the emotional side of everything is numbed, this feels like a storybook somewhere I'm a useless side character that the hero will never meet or care about. I want to feel happy, I just... don't. This blankness is what's really killing me, because now I can't build relationships or imagine a future. I'm destined to live alone and with no purpose. If you want a better grasp of the perspective, imagine seeing everyone as perfectly fine whereas you, for whatever reason, are the most ugly and screwed-up person imaginable.

Personally, I am at a point where I feel circumstantially helpless and genetically inferior... so I am hopeless. But, tbh, everything is about your perspective and what you choose to focus your attention on.  If you have the mental stregnth to seek help, get on medication, pursue interests you like and meet people through them and accept your reality, than maybe just maybe you can get better.

It sounds like trying to work backwards from what you think makes other lives worth living, what you think validates their lives. But a vexed approach. Those things may enrich a experience and situations, but they confer meaning and significance in and of a cart before the horse thing. We get value from lists of attributes, you just plug in these arbitrary conditions and get a happy human that lives an engaging life. And, more importantly, you fixate on those attributes and dream that those magical little things are what stand between you and your sense of fulfillment and worth. You have to start smaller and construct that sense of purpose and wellbeing piece by piece. You have to make little investments in your immediate world that contribute something to that.",0

8313,I had a therapist for a few months. It was nice to have someone who legally can't tell anyone anything you tell them.,2
8314,"Yep. In conversations with my therapist, we have discussed me having some kind of attachment disorder around this. I am constantly seeking and craving connection with others. I can be at an airport and be thinking about connecting with other people. We traced it to childhood stuff (no surprise there) of abandonment and alienation, unmet emotional needs. Then when and if I do connect, my expectations are pretty high since I am willing to do whatever to reach out to the other person and increase the connection. When that is not reciprocated to the expectations that I have (because they are not trying to fill the massive hole that I am), I feel rejected and then shut down. I internalize this sense as a rejection of me as a person (they don't like me, I'm not worth liking, they got to know and discovered i'm no good). Rinse. Repeat. That's my pattern at least. Knowing the pattern helps, but it doesn't mean I can always identify it and stop it. Thanks for letting me share.",0

I believe that I'm correct that life is pointless, unnecessary, and more painful than pleasurable.

But guess what, I haven't missed a single day of work aside from 9 day vacation that I took scattered here and there.

Funny thing, my supervisor almost cried today at work and was complaining in a high pitched voice xD. It kinda brightened my day LOL.",2
8342,"Youa re comdemned to a life of freedom. Is an old quote i tihnk its from satre, but im not sure. And later there has been others who disagree. You are forced to become alive and aware that much is for sure. Unlike most animals you are a creature born with the abillity gather information and draw conclusion not jsut based on your senses, and that oftens leads to the question. Why am i alive? Not only that, you are forced into not just a world, but a particular part of the word, which then in turn will teach you values and conformaty, and for some people this works out well. If you can find it in yourself to look at the context you have born into and be satisfied with it, enjoy it and love it, if you can find shelter, food, sleep, joy, love and challenge in you enviroment. But for some of us, we don't fin those things, we suddenly find ourself in a enviroment that conflicts with our nature, the context of our existence is not operationable with the essence of our nature. You first statement i cannot, say is wrong, you didn't decide to exist, but netiher did you chose not to. And existing in of itself is not evil or good. But if the context of your life is making your life or nature feel haunted and painful. Then a there are options available. The first thing, no matter how you want to change your context for the better, rquires that you step back and see the context. Where are you from, what values have been impsoed on you, which makes sense to you which doesn't, how has these values been imposed, who has impsoed them. For these purposes your reasoning is a great tool. It easy to finda figure head or a single person to blame, but you really have to map it out, and see udnerstand ana analyse your einvirotment and the people in it, and then find the conflicts with your nature, the pain and sadness. Then you have to figure out a plan. And this is a tremendous task, not just do you have to think thoguhts you ahve not been taught to think, you have to be critical of a system that raised you and shaped you. You have to go against the nature of what normal is and accept yourself. And then you ahve to find out how you want to change the context of your life. alkohol amkes me miserable, and everyone i know drinks Find people you can exist with with out alcohol My father is violent Create an existence were you are independant from him School is terrible translate My class mates bully me daily Find another school thes are simple i know, and jsut examples. Now i know you asked why do i have to do all this hard work and i threw some of the most difficult work and ideas at you. But the things is all what ive jsut said is the reasonalbe arguemtn for you nature, essence and existence and a way to improve it. when you ask why, reason is not a tool that can answer. its like trying to build a ship using lead, sure maybe it can be done, but its deffinately not the best way. Refelection, abstract thought, contemplation, emotion, empathy. those are the tools to arrive at an answer. If reason was used, human life wouldn't really have value. If you were the head of state and only used reason, you would quickly realize, human lives are not what drives you foward, what makes progress and creates a super power. And lives could turn into numbers. Sure educated people anda strong work force is good reasonable arguments to have a population, but only if they are educated or strong. Using reason to determine worth of life can lead to terrible ideas or no answers. You have to work hard right now, because you are worth it depsise allt he pain you are in you are worth it, and you deserve to be your best you. And if you don't liek working 8 hours a day then sleep 8 hours and then have 8 hours for yourself. Then there are options, but because you born into this context you ahve to work hard to get to those oprions. It is hard to change your enviroment. You have to stay alive becuase, you know a humans life has worth and you are one. When you see another in pain you wish he wouldn't ahve to be, when i see your words and want to help you but am incapable i still try. You have worth because of all the thigns you have not done yet, and all the people who have not enjoyed you future self. Stay strong friend Love I wish i speleld better",2

I believe that you are not surrounding yourself with the right people, but it's true that most of the times we don't really get to choose who we meet. Having a caring heart is nothing to be ashamed of, and it would be a pity if your kindness gets lost in the midst of the crowd just because you want to fit in. There are a lot of people like you, that I can assure you, so as long as you are at peace with your thoughts and with who you are I'd suggest you should keep on being yourself. Take care (:",0

8354,yes I distinctly remember being very happy until people started bullying me for being gay. the feelings of emptiness and shame closed me off from normal development and have never left despite years of therapy. this eventually turned into chronic depression and failed relationships. straight men who proudly make gay jokes as if its some disgusting or abnormal thing to be avoided and mocked while they feel open and free to express their own sexual experiences have blood on their hands.,2

I do it all the time because I need to think clearly and **focus**. Staring at moving people with different shapes, clothes and colors distract my focus and disrupt my peace of mind and suck my **energy**. But I like it when people direct their attention to me and stare at me because they subconsciously feed me with their energy and make me feel alive and they loose their vital energy in return which is **s**o sad. I need to stare at the horizon or the sky to focus and to give for the moment a **meaning** that the majority can not see because they are busy talking to others, staring at others, using their phones and giving their consent and **paying attention** and their **time** to others for nothing in return.

An example Some one who is desperately trying to lose wieght will put himself ahead with a struggle to his mind and body, but he knows that the outcome is what matters. He has to deal with discomfort to loose his wieght. There's no other way, that's just how life is. A surgery to lose wieght would be a pass.

The term fetishizing is used in a harsh, accusatory, pejorative way, blaming the characters for perpetually watching their lives through the blackest prism, but the truth is they just do not know any better than to do so. Furthermore, fetishes are often believed to be shameful and obscene in nature, because such random, nonsexual items PRODUCE intense satisfaction, whereas people that are accused of fetishizing sadness are just sheltering themselves (if i fuck myself up, no one else will).",0

It's normal for them to help you and you don't have to pay them back for that.  Don't be too hard on you. You seem like nice person ! Good luck",0
8409,"I know this feeling all too well. The last six months for me have been the absolute worst in many many different ways.  You don't get healed -- ever -- but you get something better if you can just force yourself to ride it out. What you're feeling now gets compressed and you're able to focus and use it to enact whatever changes you need in your life.  One thing I feel like you really need to hear is that you deserve better, a lot better than what you've been getting. You're not worthless, you don't have to settle, you should be treated better, you should own a big piece of this world instead of being crushed by it.",2

8411,"Music had always affected my moods depending on what I listen to. When I need a boost of happiness or motivation I like to listen to Alexander desplat or Hans zimmer or James horner. Honestly, I am just a huge orchestra person and, since it doesn't have lyrics, I can pretend it's the soundtrack to my life and feel more courageous to get moving. There's also another Reddit user (I wish I could remember where or who it was) but they suggested doing at least one thing whenever you get up to go pee or get water. Then, you can push it to doing two things when you feel more motivated. Please be kind and have patience with yourself. Depression is an ongoing war with many battles. Celebrate your wins and don't berate yourself when you're not doing as well as you wish. Take baby steps you can easily accomplish and grow from there. I hope you have a great day tomorrow and if you ever need some support, just send me a PM hugs in the meantime",2

8413,"I'll give you the /relationships answer: Hit the lawyer, delete the gym. Or like, the other way around. I know, not married, but it still cheers me up to say that :) Some people are shit. But mostly, people are clueless. People are at different places, different stages in their life. Find any average girl in her late twenties or older, and they'll likely be able to tell you some things they did to dudes they weren't proud of after the fact, but at the time, seemed like the most sane and logical thing, something they needed to do. Guys do the same, just in a different manner. On both sides, it hurts like hell, and is something everyone goes through. Focus on yourself. Not the Tony Robbins rah-rah go you! I mean depression hits, end of relationships suck, they mess with your head and your body. Gym is good because it helps both your self confidence and makes both your body and your head feel better. Best of luck :)",0
8414,"Medications work differently for everyone. Usually your doctor or psychiatrist will prescribe you with different ones depending on what you have tried that hasn't worked.

Try reading Peter Wessel Zappffe's writings and Man's Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl. If nothing else, try to find a purpose. In my own experience, existential crises don't just go away. You've got to confront them head on. Force a change, create a mission for yourself. The worst thing you can do is nothing, and succumb to the negative feelings that come with the crisis. Attack it with whatever you have.",2

Not to say that I'm perfect now or that I still don't get down but I reached out to those I care about and the amount of support was overwhelming. Have you talked to your fiance about how you're feeling?",2
8430,"I think accepting that you are YOU rather than that you are ugly could help. Because you ARE you. You're no one else, and you never will be. You have one body, and no matter how you feel about it, it's all you have. You don't have to like your body at this point, just accept that it is yours.  I just try to accept the intrusive thoughts for what they are: intrusive thoughts. They're intruding. They don't belong in my head. I don't have to listen to them. They can be there, but they don't have to mean anything to me. I'm stronger than they are. I know the truth. They're just trying to confuse me. That sort of thing.

I tapered off quickly, on the expectation that the mental pain of getting fat this quickly was going to counteract any benefit from the drug.  I went off and I'm on gabapentin now, and melatonin, and that usually keeps the insomnia at bay.  I used to tell myself meds were a weakness, but being on them is far better than getting fired from a job, which was in the cards if I hadn't gone to see a therapist. I know it feels shameful, but really, it's no different than needing glasses, or a coat when it's cold. If your current meds help you, stay on them, and don't feel bad about it.",2

Try to see what about your life you hate so much, specifics, and try to change those things. PLay with things you are scared to do, do things that will make you feel better about yourself and your life, read positive mantras, read books that make your mental concept of the world expand. Force yourself onto new experiences. I think with time one's self loathing can be softened. After all the self loathing didnt come from you but from other's, from the environment. Babies dont hate themselves.",0
8438,Same here. How do I cope with it? Hmm I think I just resigned in getting a girlfriend or better finding 'true love'. I'm just getting sick when I see couples and wish to exit the world.  I read somewhere that you should love yourself first and then love follows along or something like that. It's very hard to me because I feel like a piece of shid. Well atleast I have series and animes to kill my time.,2

You don't know his life, you don't know his past, his environment, nothing, how in the world could you make a statement that yes, rejoice, his life WILL undoubtedly get better? That's a very corrosive statement to make which DOES NOT HELP the person you're telling it to. For OP. Could you maybe find a reason to live in the fact that if you get out of this abusive life you're living in and build a life that you're proud of, that will show your family how better of a person you are than them? Would you find comfort and maybe willpower in that?",0

So it kind of makes sense that they would have different results and resulting feelings about their life since their life is so different. But the good news is, you can have a happy, fuller life too. What you should do is list out the top five things you don't like about your life. Then you should spend some time working on the one that is bothering you the most. In my experience, when I was unhappy with my life it was because I was neglecting some part of my life that was really nagging me. Rooting for you! Hope this helps.",2

8468,"Its a bummer, I know exactly how you're feeling. I usually try not not feel too much of anything. I brush off happiness with the knowledge that whatever good happened is a rarity I shouldn't get used to or acknowledge. Sadness is can always be treated with a few stiff drinks or an exhausting run. That kind of thinking makes me pretty numb but I'm okay with it, until I find a consistent source of happiness.",2

And it's horribly wrong when people ask you those questions I'm so mad right now fuck man That guy has 0 empathy. I know you mad af but after you calm down try to look forward and hold onto yourself. You don't need them to save you. They should be supporting you, if not then not. Don't give a shit about them. It's a beautiful world but some people have 0 empathy.

It was like I had been designed to be the perfect malfunction so I cant do academics.  I am different but I'd rather be dead then looked down upon by some other idiot who can do things I can't. I can do something better then they can, know how to go through hard times and keep pushing.  When life gets hard for them they will break, and I won't be there to help them.

How would I remember to learn, be good at school, how would I remember to do all the other things I kept forgetting? How could I be anything more than terrible, like I seemed to keep being.

(kind and excitable and loving) when you're suffering, first and foremost what you need is to get better. being loved, by family or friends or a partner, is part of that. having a partner is not essential, though. i can talk about this for hours if you want me to, but it's important for any relationship you have to be healthy and not turn toxic. you are not a burden, you are not unlovable. at this point in your life people who you have close relations with have to be able to understand and support you. and you deserve that, and those people exist. it can be hard to imagine, when people are depressed their life is usually not in a state where they're very connected to like-minded people. but anything can happen, and things can change. and even without change, you can encounter great things. i can tell you about my experience if you ever want.",2

It's really fucking difficult to wear a mask all the time, but at least it's marginally better that being alone all the time, isn't it? Most people don't want to associate with someone who is severely depressed and deathly anxious, and I can't even blame them.. If I do act like how I feel, I'm probably a nightmare to be around, because there's an aura of sadness and hopelessness that surrounds me. How can I expect anyone to approach me? Even if there is someone who does, it would be crazy to expect them to completely accept a miserable wreck like me. I mean, I can't just take and not give.. And then there's the people who act all smug and give you all that fucking moronic rose-tinted glasses shit with an air of superiority, a la /r/wowthanksimcured, and you feel even worse.

It is not a reflection of what you are worth nor how successful your life is. Even if you would get more followers, what would this solve? You would not even know who most of those people are. I also doubt that an illusion like this could provide anyone with actual happiness. And Instagram has a pretty messed up algorithm anyway, I would personally not even bother.",2
8575,"That's a pretty profound question, but I think happiness is something that a lot of people don't understand. In a period or prolonged period of despair, I don't believe there can be happiness at all, and it's only after that period has been solved, over, attacked enough by effort and time, that you can start experiencing happiness. I don't think happiness and gratitude should be forced, or you should try to feel happy when you truly cannot feel happy. I'm still going through that period, and there might be rivets or jewels of happiness along the way, but they are fleeting and leave very quickly.  The whole reason why people despair is because they are tied so strongly to negative emotional memories that they outweigh any trivial positive emotional memories. Think about it, which memories are the quickest, strongest, and most easily able to be remembered for you? The most emotional ones.  If your most emotional memories are negative, you will be in despair. On the converse, if one's most emotional memories are positive, you will be in a state of happiness.  There is a way to end your despair, you just have to face it head on and let go of everything, and keep trying to let go and accept. Very few people have any science on this and might be the thing we need to explore the most as a society as a whole.",2

I look at it like this: As a kid, I would throw tantrums in the grocery store if my mom wouldn't buy my favourite cereal. A couple years later, I could handle that, but I cried when I got cut from the basketball team. A couple years after that, I was nearly suicidal when my girlfriend dumped me. I eventually learned to handle rejection, but full time work drove me to drug abuse. Now, I can handle working 50 hours a week. The point is I have always had terrible coping skills. None of my problems have ever been that bad, but they have been the biggest problem I ever faced. They always seem overwhelming because I don't know how to handle failure of rejection of really any kind of pain or even mild discomfort. I am a wimp. And yet, they still treated me at the hospital - multiple times. I was never told to suck it up; I was taken seriously and given the help I need. It isn't about the external circumstances, it's about how we react to them. So if you need help, *that's okay*. You aren't any less of a person. You are worth just as much as anyone else.

It's a daily nightmare.  I would say that MAYBE, if I gave advice on it, it would be that I used to have a similar thing with shyness, and with that I pushed myself into more and more social situations and now am not so shy. It MAYBE might work the same way with liking/disliking social interaction. But I do that everyday and I still don't like people. I'm more COMFORTABLE around them, but I still don't LIKE them. And it's an entirely different ball park with depression/anxiety than shyness, otherwise if it were so easy to just 'force' yourself to socialize to fix the problem, I'd be doing it myself.

Get to know people. Talk to them, be their friends. If you have any party or any event, go. You will eventually find someone that likes you, and you like her. Also, don't look for sex. You will never fuck on the first date, and sex is not the only thing that matters in life. Would you fuck a doll with no feelings? Always talk with girls with the mentality that you won't have sex with them. Gurls also feel love.  3- Keep living with your pillow. If you don't have the motivation or will to do the 2 things i mentioned earlier, remember that atleast you will have a pillow that loves you, and a anonymous redditor that cares about you.",0
8633,"I understand your thought process but hiding or lying will make it worse for you and for them (when they find out the truth). I have adopted a policy of soft truth when talking about depression with loved ones. Let me explain: There is some drama inherent to despair - you feel all alone, like nothing will ever get better, you feel like you're choking on it, etc. And that's a lot for normal people to deal with. So I try to state the facts like a robot and not be super descriptive or let myself get too worked up. Keeping my cool helps them do the same, and it's not really a lie, I'm just choosing how much I want to express. It's like I'm a bottle of soda that's been really shaken up, and if you take the cap off like normal it's going to explode all over your face. But if you do it really slowly you let the carbonation out in a manageable way and then you can drink your soda and everyone's happy.",2
8634,"I find that how you view failure is tied to your expectations quite heavily. Or also the pressure of feeling others' expectations of you on your shoulders.  I still haven't worked things out that I'm able to effectively handle failure myself, but mainly people can feel better when they fail, because they recognise it as a learning experience, or it is an inevitable part of the process. Now this may sound obvious, but when in the moment, it is very easy to forget this and lose sight of progress after the failure. Failure can appear in many forms.  My expectation of a 'good outcome', instead was a horrible mistake... Or was it? I'm sorry to hear you feeling even worse after your suicide attempt. Just know that I believe you are alive, and fighting, and you will come out of this stronger.",2
8635,What were you taking before vs what are you taking now? Are you being prescribed by your general doctor or a psychiatrist? Do you feel like you are in danger right now?,2

8644,"it's just one of those normal things in life, we'll keep on trying and we'll keep on failing. The reason success feels good is because you work for it. Don't let disappointment get to you, look at it this way, being disappointment means you know you could've done better. Your time &amp; effort isn't wasted as long as you learn from what you did. Just keep on.  am I making sense? sorry for rambling",2
8645,Why can't you ask your parents for help?,2
8646,"At the last minutes i kinda regret it, especially if i had to fall asleep while it's the dawn, i hate dawn. I have noticed that i sleep much better during the day, i even fall asleep easily during a day, even if i keep the normal mode of awake/sleeping.",0
8647,"When you're in the darkest part of a depressive hole it feels like you finally see the truth - that the problem is you and you're stuck with it. But it does come in cycles. I like to start small, take control of whatever I can. Control is empowering. It could be a simple as just playing the shit out of a stupid flash game, or clearing out all the spam in your email, or reorganising your room. Just find something to keep yourself moving. Writing can help too, just lay it all out there. Seeing your words outside your head can help break the downward spiral of thinking. If it's worse now then that means was better, and it will be eventually. Think of someone you can talk to, who knows you well, and just hit them up and say hi. Maybe a text, maybe an email, just remind yourself that you are not alone. It's a shitty battle but stick it out if you can. If you have a therapist try reaching out to one, and if you don't then see if you can get a friend or a parent to help you find one. There's nothing magic about professional help, but it does work sometimes and that's reason enough to get the process rolling if you feel like you can. Send me PM if you want to vent more or anything, you're not alone and you can survive this",2
8648,I'm in the same boat. Actually just took way too many pills and hope i don't wake up. If I do then I guess it's not my time. Keep your head up. Its not worth it.,2
8649,"I'd say that they choose to endure it... It's just that they have a more hopeful insight, they can fully understand something good will happen from their work, and they can grasp that it's real. That's why I sometimes wonder if Depression is stunted cognition (maybe imagination), because if I could imagine the beauty that life has to offer I'm sure that no matter what got in my way I'd plow through. Why would neurotypicals work so hard if they couldn't in some way see the other side, feel it, almost experiencing it? I just think we're unable to do that.",0

8651,"The only part of your life you get to experience is the present, and you gotta set aside some of that experience for the future. The past will always be happier or sadder because you have to recreate it every time and it gets a bit more distorted every time.",0
8652,Wow. I'm seriously in the same exact position. It sucks man. Dated a girl I care deeply about but deep down I know I'm better off alone (or at least the depression says I am). Can't decide if we should just end it or continue. I'm gonna have a ton of regret either way.,2
8653,"I get it. At some point a few years ago I stopped being able to feel joy. Even when I'm feeling stable, I still don't feel *happy*. When I've described this to my therapist and psychiatrist, they challenge me on it -- you talk about good things, don't you feel happy when those happen? -- but I know the difference. It is very much like an old, lost friend. I actually might use that metaphor in therapy this week.",2
8654,I don't wanna get up at all either but I have a stupid appointment to go to.,0
8655,"At least you want to help people! Some love hurting people or just ignoring them, you care and the most important thing.",2
8656,"pretty normal for our age bracket. The 20s are a fucking catastrophe where finding yourself and acclimatising to adulthood is concerned. A lot of people feel that way so go thinking all alone in that. 24, dropped out of my animal husbandry degree, started a science one, dropped out of my forensic science degree, had a string of jobs that never last over 5 months and as emotionally stunted as they get- trust me. On the pathetic scale up there too. But not to say you change, you have to just put in the effort, or fake it till you make it.",2
8657,"I am. It's hard to be sober, because I don't feel like the fun joyful person I am when I'm drunk. When I'm not drunk I'm depressed and anxious and in pain and I hate it. And I'm sorry that you're feeling like this :( I'm here for ya",2
8658,I feel you. Realizing how depressed you really are is pretty scary. Best of luck with all your struggles.,2
8659,"Awesome! That's a success in my book. :)  I managed to call someone and spoke to an actual human being about my car yesterday, now if only I could set up all the other appointments I need to lol.  Keep doing small things like that, it helps you feel like you've accomplished something especially when they start to pile up after a bit. Maybe eventually we'll be productive right?",2

8668,"Whoa, easy. Whoever she is, and whatever you did, chances are not as irreparable as you think. Time will heal most wounds. And if it is really irreparable, then you move on. One incident is not indicative of your worth as a human being, nor does one opinion determine whether you are good or bad. It might hurt to move on, like *really* hurt, but alright. normal.",0
8669,I've been that way since a toddler. Never wanted to go outside if it was sunny--only at night or on cloudy days. Still avoid sunlight to an unhealthy degree haha. My folks joke about how pale I am :} I'm seeing now that sunlight avoidance seems to be a common thread w/ depressed folks... at least in this sub. Odd since light therapy is a proven treatment for improving mood. I get horribly depressed every Spring so I feel like my brain is wired backward.,2
8670,"Sounds like apathy to me. I'm guessing you feel kind of lost and without a direction and you just are following the path that you feel is required of you. While apathy is one symptom of depression, it doesn't necessarily mean that you have depression. By no means am I downplaying depression or trying to convince you that nothing is wrong because there isn't any on true definition of depression. I felt like you for a while, just a few small pleasures but nothing really else. For me, it went away after a few months. If you want to talk about it more or anything, feel free to ask anything. My only advice is don't give up now, because if it goes away, you'll regret a lot of things that you stopped caring about.",2

8674,got you feeling like this? Can you describe?,2

8676,"Sometimes you really need to be reminded of that other side and that you will in fact return to it. Don't make any big decisions when in the heat of the moment.

Despite these people not knowing you, we're all in this together. Keep your head up",2

As a two-time suicide survivor and multiple abuse survivor, I know I can't fault anyone for doing what they do.

If you see this going somewhere and lasting she will no doubt eventually figure it out, night aswell be from you.

Instead, I decided to live my life, have fun, sleep, ditch school or do whatever and just live the life as I wanted to. If you cant find motivation in one thing, than find motivation in another.

It's been about 8 months since we've broke up, I'm still grieving. It's made me fall back into depression. I always thought I could do things myself, but I just realized recently that I can't.

I feel as if everyday is a struggle for self acceptance even by myself. Everyday is a day where I am buffeted by my own worthlessness. I try my best, I do. I try my very best to get through. Every day is a drag, but at least its a drag and not a standstill.  After a while I forget people exist, really. It's just me and my depression.

Don't weigh the bad against the good and make a judgement, fight to keep the good alive for as long as you can.  You life is once in a lifetime. You're lucky to be alive and to be human.

Probably worth more than anything in existence, it can't be bought.",2

I would eat that delicious food all the time. I gained some 80 or so lbs in about 5 years. Went from 130 to 205. I quit that job about 7 years ago and have since lost most of the weight.

Do not lock yourself in your room and watch porn&amp;masturbate all long.Find something useful to do with your free time.Recharge your batteries.Start working out,you don't need to go to gym,just take a run in the morning and one in the evening.Build your emotional resilience.I do this by reading about it first (I am in the process of finding out what it means and then I have to apply it).A good start is r/Stoicism.Make yourself useful - clean your house and take care of your pets.

8743,"Music had always affected my moods depending on what I listen to. When I need a boost of happiness or motivation I like to listen to Alexander desplat or Hans zimmer or James horner. Honestly, I am just a huge orchestra person and, since it doesn't have lyrics, I can pretend it's the soundtrack to my life and feel more courageous to get moving. There's also another user (I wish I could remember where or who it was) but they suggested doing at least one thing whenever you get up to go pee or get water. Then, you can push it to doing two things when you feel more motivated. Please be kind and have patience with yourself. Depression is an ongoing war with many battles.

8755,What? As long as it's not directly physically hurting another person you should always do whatever makes you happy. And if it's suicide then that's not wrong. For some people suicide is the answer. To act like every single person ever will one day find a reason to want to live is ignorant and idiotic at best. Is there a chance you will? Of course.

Not surprising at all that it has made you feel a lot better at 3 weeks, that's when it usually kicks in for me as well. And yes they are designed to build up in your system over time.

8774,"Yeah, this feeling is a strong one. Felt it consistently for a lot of my childhood and early adulthood.  The truth is that I never dealt with it constructively, or at least in a way that could help me get to the root of that feeling.  Part of the reason I think you and I are on this subreddit in the first place is because we were never taught how to deal with that feeling constructively.  In my case, I used constant denial and self-numbing ... At some point, I just assumed the pit was a part of me I could choose to ignore. You seem to be actively trying to experience it.  You are engaging your sadness, which is objectively good for working through depression. It may not be what you might call 'conventional' but everyone does their thing a little differently :)  If what you are doing no longer works for you though, it might be best to start looking for other (healthy) ways of working through that discomfort.  Personally, when I feel that pit, I know what thoughts tend to follow it. Fortunately, my therapists (and my stay at hospital) helped me come up with ways to attack that pit when it hit me hard.  In order to redirect those thoughts that create it, I try to reach out to anyone in my support net. It's hard because I feel like they won't give a shit, but most of the time, they do (but I often choose to ignore that reality).  Or I will simply write some positive words here, on this subreddit. Reaching out to others here in positive ways is not just for others, but for my own sake as well. As you put so well, giving that pit a 'purpose'.  But don't cover that feeling up. Continue to engage with it, as best as you can. It's there for a reason. Hopefully, the more you work with it, the easier it is to process and let go.",2

It also shows you who really cares, cause calling you selfish is just choosing the victim route, for themselves, which is fucked. While some may call it manipulation. Whatever the name, it's hardly sympathetic, and isnt even close to empathetic. Which, empathy, is what this world is lacking.

You have many people who care for you, who I am quite certain will notice if you're gone, and would be devastated... not to mention the hundreds of other people you're robbing from the chance of getting to meet someone as amazing as you, too! Stay strong, and remember that it will always be okay. Life is what you make it.",2

I'm back to where I was. I moved back. No more job. No more new friends.  The only thing that keeps me going is that this right now won't be forever. It's for now and it's so debilitating. I leave my bed to use the restroom, grab something to eat back in bed, and thats it for last week at my just getting here lowest points.  And over time the time spent like this will get shorter and the time spent on that high curve will go longer and farther. I don't feel that in any way. I'm lucky to have had a decade of therapy to make me feel like I know it tho. Doesn't change the feeling at all but gives me a shred of hope to hang onto.  I'm really sorry you feel that way mate. Some people don't do well with that kinda energy but there are a lot who will not care too and help you with their energy. My dad is neutral and doesn't care, but can't really help. My mother won't even be around me when I'm down. Even told me she can't stand it. Just having the 2 people I have right now for when I am down tho helps me a lot.

8904,"I just can't stand the social media shit.  I was really messed up as a kid, chemical imbalance at birth, obese until I was 22, put on antipsychotics around 13. Stupidly stopped taking them and I just got more and more detached from reality. Combined with my very mild ASD I never really got to have much interaction with other kids outside of school, never even really had friends I would talk to during the day. I never learned how to be an adult when it comes to relationships (of all kinds). Because society just developed that way, I guess. Everybody is on their damn phones. God forbid you want to ... *gasp* ... walk up and say hi to someone on the street.  I went to university last year and it was a bit better, and liberating, but I still had big trouble connecting with anyone. I made one good friend (my roommate) and met a couple people on Tinder, I tried to go to school clubs and be proactive and not feel sorry for myself. But I just can't connect with anyone unless they are literally forced to be in a room with me, apparently. When I go back I will try to smile more. That's what everyone keeps telling me.  To answer your question, I don't think I am depressed because of how we live. I'm depressed because of what essentially amounts to bad luck. But it sure as hell makes my life a lot harder. At the same time, we are lucky to live the comfortable lives we do nowadays. If I had been born in another time, who can say if I would even be alive right now?",2

Basic detainment is 72 hours (3 days) To ensure you're not a harm to yourself or others. During that time they examine you and see your mental state. If at the end you're not showing signs of danger you are released but given options to stay for further treatment. If you are still a danger you stay and get more treatment. Now say you made an attempt and go to the ER for something, they can't always just detain you. I've been to the ER for atempt of suicide by oversosing on medication. Longest I was there was a few hours. Due to my mental state being stable they had no legal way to hold me loner than I wanted to be there. I got the drugs out of my system then was discharged and went home. There is a ton, a shit ton of misinformation and propaganda around mental illness. Be informed, do real research. Reddit isn't google. You are smart enough to do real research don't just ask strangers online for all the answers. Also get help.",2

EVERYTHING people do is for personal benefit, nowadays. From the way people start approaching others to the way people break up. * Wanna get a girlfriend? BETTER FIND ONE IN TINDER!. Yeah, let's all start liking some stupid slut's photos that will help you get laid and of course it will NEVER inflate her ego to think she Pretty and successful with men, while in fact she is a nobody to everybody. * Wanna take a girl on a date? BETTER USE MY PARENTS' MONEY TO SHOW I'M A MAN!. If the best thing you have to offer to the opposite sex for them to appreciate, is money that aren't even yours (and for them to like you) why the hell are you allowed to have children?

I understand that what I am saying might seem over-dramatic to some of you(or all of you) but let me tell you some thinks about me: I am 27, I graduated the university after studying there for 8 years because I had to work and serve my conscription to the army, I've lived(and still am) my whole life with my mother because we were too poor to have a separate house, haven't found a job since I graduated because the financial crisis has ravaged my country and I feel like I have little will and reason to live anymore.

I hate to say this, but school academics come over sports. If time mangement is becoming hard, maybe ask if you can lower yourself from captian position. Freshmen year is easiest for most, so you might want to get help now to save yourself from only deciding to change say in junior year.

Joining a club at uni, having friends keep me motivated in my studies. Also sort of having something to do outside of classes (I don't have a job). Make friends in your course, it helps to know you're not the only one in struggle town, and if you get stuck you can ask someone. Also think hard about why you're studying what you're studying, be in it for the right reasons. Keep in mind university isn't for everyone, and it isn't the only way to lead a fulfilling life. Also career changes are very common so since you're in your final year you can just stick it out and know that the future awaits.

This will make finding strategies and solutions much easier for the therapist, and you just might find out a few things about yourself :) Good Luck",2
8997,Any family that can help you? I don't know how I could have done it without my mom.,2
8998,"Perhaps that's not such a bad thing for the time being - at least it sounds like you're still doing the necessities of life whether you want to or not and whether there's anything resembling pleasure in it. It seems that's how I've been operating for a few years myself - doing things because I have to not because I want to. At least we're doing them, maybe we'll get our mojo back and want to do something later.",2
8999,Yes. I feel like if I'm not being helpful/useful then I'm pretty much worthless,2
9000,"Ok, you walk with a limp and that probably sucks. Still, a lot of things you can do. I'm sure it's not as off-putting as you feel it is. Does your limp make you depressed or is there more?",2
9001,Yeah i feel ya its kinda like a part of a song that i once wrote every single night in my dreams i die waking up dissapointed im still alive,2
9002,Does you happiness rely on other people's behavior?,2
9003,Sounds very similar to myself. Depression is a common part of my life but even when I'm not going through a cycle I still suffer from this blank mind where I simply can't organize a thought or put anything into words. I've come to a realization that it may be a form of anxiety. For me it can feel like an internal panic attack. I wish I could offer you some words of wisdom but I'm just know starting my battle to overcome it.,2
9004,"I agree with what you're saying. What about suicide do you find difficult? Just getting the nerve to actually do it, worrying about the consequences, etc.?",2
9005,its so weird being depressed and feeling like i cant help other depressed people. so when i think of what to say my first thought is WEL1 W4T I5 MAKING U DEPRESSED? Is there something going on in your life bud?,0
9006,Depression can be cyclical. Our brain's chemistry gets out of whack and we feel like crap for a few days and then we feel better when it gets back to normal. Good luck and try to push through it.,2
9007,I don't really know if it's the Cymbalta. I haven't experienced that myself when on it. How long have you been on it? Maybe it's still building up?,2
9008,Instead of trying to think of something good why not set out to make something good. Doesn't have to be major just something small each day,0
9009,What happened?? Who hurted you?,0
9010,You have one of the best names ever seen.,2
9011,Don't do it. Tell me your story! I'd love to hear.,2
9012,"Same here, friend. What's your favourite Zeppelin song or album?",2
9013,"I've definatley been there, but if I've learned anything through my depression, deployments, college and life in general is that it always gets worse before it start s to get better. And I know how cliche that might sound but I can vouch for it. Life isn't going to be easy, whoever says it is, is fucking lying. Life is about perception, mentality over reality. You are strong enough to survive, you can make it, but you have to believe in yourself. Don't let people, or work, or circumstance dictate you. Only let yourself dictate who you are. You can do this",2
9014,"I'm so sorry, I understand your loss. My grandma just passed away on 05/26. It's hard to accept that we will never spend time with them again and that everything we have now is just our memories. I know it seems cliche, but it really does get better with time.",2
9015,I'm drowning too. Everyday. It easy to take shit for granted. I never thought my life would get worse. I thought I was invincible but life fucks you up in so many ways. You need to find some inspirational music and listen to it a lot. Maybe make a goal for something. I know it all seems futile but little things sometimes help. But I know how hard it can be. When you're caught under those dark deep waves. Surrounded by onlookers on their cruise. It's easy to say fuck it but you deserve to be happy.. I hope u can find something that helps you through this darkness.,2
9016,"Depression is a hard fight. I am 29, on meds and I still struggle. All I can add is to start with yourself. Keep a daily routine, like hygiene or reading, find something that allows you to clear your mind and be calm. Go to work or go to school and be yourself. Always find something that can make you laugh. A great sense of humor and a good personality can for real change the way people see you. I had terrible acne as a child and hated how I looked, but as I grew older I gained more friends through my humor. I only really have 2 friends but they are great friends. Quality over quantity and all that jazz. As for being single I too am in the double digit bus. I go from periods of loathing being alone to being numb to being okay with it. My friends and the things that make me laugh help ease that pain.",2
9017,"Well, is moved into a new home a few months ago, befor that i always had to walk 30 - 60 minutes to get where ever i had to go (sschool, work, train station and so on). Everyone was always so confused why i liked to walk the whole way, even if someone would offer me to drive to work,s chool, or back home again. I just liked to put my headphones on, listen to music, and let my thoughts just flow. I HAD to go from A to B, so i wouldn't worry about something i still have to do, because i could do nothing while i had to walk from A to B. I could just disconnect from my life for a while. And it always felt great. Dont get me wrong, all the bad thoughts, the bad emotions and feelings weren't gone, but it was just different, in a beautiful way. It seems like sometimes we have to force our mind to get some rest in a way or another.",0
9018,"Find a new one. I've had several therapists, and too many of them were just a really bad fit. Especially the last one, she was super nice but way, way not helpful to me. I'd blame myself too if sessions weren't good. There's some classic depression for ya. But I guess it's common knowledge to try different therapists until you get a good fit? I didn't know that for years so now I kinda overcompensate by telling everyone to shop around as needed. Good luck.",2
9019,Was never diagnosed. (I would say that being suicidal is a pretty good sign though.),0
9020,I just turned 20. 20 more years is an awfully long time. It hurts to even think it's gonna last that long.,0
9021,I'm so sorry you feel that way. Would you like to elaborate? I'm here if you need to chat,2
9022,Only more recently. I went through a new and confusing situation and thinking about it now gets me angry because I can't change anything about it yet I still have the irrational feelings,2

9024,Yeah kinda. Hopefully we can upgrade to a real straw someday.,2

9027,"I feel you dude, I am 25 and I have never had a girlfriend, I don't know how it feels to get hugged, there were never a girl in my life, who said she likes me for who I am. No friends or family, who are trying to cheer me up. Just me, work and my depressed thoughts that are preventing me to fall asleep every night. I am so lonely, it feels like deep cuts into my heart. I want to end this fucking pain.",2
9028,What help do you want,2
9029,"No, that is just really bad withdrawal. Don't confuse that for how you were without them.",0
9030,The fact that I'll die xD,0
9031,"I understand your thought process but hiding or lying will make it worse for you and for them (when they find out the truth). I have adopted a policy of soft truth when talking about depression with loved ones. Let me explain:  There is some drama inherent to despair - you feel all alone, like nothing will ever get better, you feel like you're choking on it, etc. And that's a lot for normal people to deal with. So I try to state the facts like a robot and not be super descriptive or let myself get too worked up. Keeping my cool helps them do the same, and it's not really a lie, I'm just choosing how much I want to express. It's like I'm a bottle of soda that's been really shaken up, and if you take the cap off like normal it's going to explode all over your face. But if you do it really slowly you let the carbonation out in a manageable way and then you can drink your soda and everyone's happy.",2
9032,"Yeah, maybe they are trying to make you feel good. If you have people saying you're cute, though, then that's a big deal! Even if they're doing it for other reasons, you're a lot more cute and attractive than me (based on this being a complaint rather than being flattered)",2
9033,Thirty-three but no kids. It's honestly a struggle being around my nieces and nephew when I'm not doing well so I give you credit.,0
9034,I am sorry I'm alive,2
9035,I'm glad that it helped you. :),2
9036,"*raises hand* Nope, I'm not happy. Sorry if I was supposed to say something different, but I try to tell the truth. Some of thes I visit make me feel less lonely, because I identify with the people who contribute content there. I often get depressed, and I'm hoping that lurking here at r/depression will help me find new ways to deal with it, by learning from the other people here. That's why I subscribed here today. A lot of people find part of their meaning for life in other people. Maybe that's why communities like this help, I don't know.",0
9037,Yes. I also have anxiety issues so if I'm not fumbling my words because of that I'm struggling to follow my own thought process because of the fog. I'm sure I appear to be the most awkward/weird/air head around. Because of this I stay home most all of the time and don't socialize or anything.,2
9038,Go for a walk or run. Get tired so your body feels like shit. Then your mind will focus on that shit feeling instead of making them up. It works for me,2

9040,"How old are you? Can you get an appointment with your primary doctor? Even a regular doctor can help you if you just talk to them. They can get you to the right place. I went through the same thing trying to tell my doctor something was wrong. It turned out he asked me. Sometimes they'll ask a generic have you been feeling down or helpless, have you had any suicidal thoughts etc. I think they're getting better at making it easier to talk about. It's worth a shot. Good luck.",2
9041,I feel this way too. It doesn't help that our world is owned and run by lying sociopaths.,2
9042,"Why do you feel like that? It makes me sad to read something like that, often the good people in this world have the most troubles, but please dont give up.",2
9043,I feel that it's hard to exist. It hurts. But I'm scared to kill my self. What if things get better? If I killed myself I wouldn't be there to enjoy the things in life that I wish for. what the fuck do I do?,2
9044,you are beautiful. pretty sure i've seen your username before,2
9045,That may be the case but seems like practicing stoicism is also option to have a supposed happy life I know about you but for me to realized that every little thing that I worry about is just so small to the rest of the world that I help myself but to chuckle I expect anything good to happen to me from now on and all these minor inconviences will eventually end at some point So why bother worrying about it?,0

I still cant function like a normal, productive citizen despite going back to work numerous times. Its even harder when the peoppe around you judge. Im 31 now and most of my peers have their own houses by now. Its so agonizing for me even though i am happy for them. Ill keep trying to get myself back though. Im sorry youre going through this OP.",2

9050,"Yeah, happened to me aswell, it's quite interesting.",2
9051,"I'm down in that hole. Don't get sucked in is my advice. You'll get nothing good out of it. The thing with alcohol is that, once you start drinking too much, too often, the idea that it makes you feel better is entertained while it is not true at all. It's: *I drink to forget, but I've drank so much I don't know what it is I have to forget. So I drink, just to be sure.* Alcohol and drugs have become a habit for me and I can't really live without them anymore. I need them to maintain a level of tolerable shittiness - but trust me, I'd be way less miserable if I never started it.",0

9056,Keep an eye on them. Check up on them because it always happens when you least expect it. Try to talk to your friend that has personal issues. give advice just tell them your there for them.,0
9057,"I always see couples and hate them. Not because I am a bad person (or maybe I am), but mostly because of why I don't have anyone.  I've come to the conclusion that people are so shit on everything that they shouldn't be allowed to reproduce. Every single one I've met is always doing stuff for himself/herself. EVERYTHING people do is for personal benefit, nowadays. From the way people start approaching others to the way people break up.  * Wanna get a girlfriend? BETTER FIND ONE IN TINDER!. Yeah, let's all start liking some stupid slut's photos that will help you get laid and of course it will NEVER inflate her ego to think she Pretty and successful with men, while in fact she is a nobody to everybody. * Wanna take a girl on a date? BETTER USE MY PARENTS' MONEY TO SHOW I'M A MAN!. If the best thing you have to offer to the opposite sex for them to appreciate, is money that aren't even yours (and for them to like you) why the hell are you allowed to have children? We don't any more of you ass***s running around.  I understand that what I am saying might seem over-dramatic to some of you(or all of you) but let me tell you some thinks about me: I am 27, I graduated the university after studying there for 8 years because I had to work and serve my conscription to the army, I've lived(and still am) my whole life with my mother because we were too poor to have a separate house, haven't found a job since I graduated because the financial crisis has ravaged my country and I feel like I have little will and reason to live anymore.  I wish something happened and people couldn't have sex for over a year. Only then would society come to the place it was supposed to be. Too many sluts and too many rich kids doing shit they want.",0

9063,"the thing, though, your death be feasible. Your mom and sibling would spend the rest of their lives wondering if it was something they did or said that pushed you over the edge, or thinking about what they could have done differently to be there for you. One of both of them would likely spiral into a depression of their own. I used to think that no one would miss me much if I killed myself, but always remember the sound of my brothers voice when he found me with blood pouring from my arm. That something that you can just get over. Even leaving notes really help the pain for your family. Also consider the suffering of the people who found you. It could be an RA or a dorm mate. They would be traumatized for life, with severe PTSD from seeing a dead, decomposing body. That point would be too late for you to do anything, so we try not to let it go that far. get me wrong, I know where coming from, and not trying to make you feel bad for would be wrong. And clear from the fact that even thinking about these things that you have some reservations, so build on that. Take every little good thing that happens to you and imagine never feeling that way again, and imagine robbing the people you love of those feelings as well. Forgive me for being brash, but there is absolutely nothing delicate or glorious about suicide. The people who experience it secondhand go through ten times the suffering of the people who commit it. Please, for the sake of a stranger on the internet who cares about you, think again. There is hope out there, even if everything seems hopeless right now.",2

You don't know his life, you don't know his past, his environment, nothing, how in the world could you make a statement that yes, rejoice, his life WILL undoubtedly get better? That's a very corrosive statement to make which DOES NOT HELP the person you're telling it to.  For OP. Could you maybe find a reason to live in the fact that if you get out of this abusive life you're living in and build a life that you're proud of, that will show your family how better of a person you are than them? Would you find comfort and maybe willpower in that?",2

I understand why it upsets you, people like us, most people with depression, hang on to the little negative things throughout their day that most people brush off, and they eat away at us. But I want you to know, that it's okay. If it really made you uncomfortable, confront him / her about it. Or talk to HR if you want. Or your boss, or whomever.

I'm pretty sure we were just born with it and you can only treat it. I myself am still trying to fight it but It's only been maybe like 8 years so I'm sure it will get better eventually.

The second is Resolve, and it comes out on the days where I just completely dropped my momentum. These days are much harder, and I have to remember that its worth continuing on, that there's always a little beauty in every moment, even if it's sad beauty, and that I am able to help in the world.

Maybe because in the end of all of this, there is a light at the end of the tunnel. Last night I had an incredibly suicidal episode; I've hurt myself in the past as well. And while I don't know how you feel personally, I can relate. When I feel the way I do, it's really hard to try and see the world around me. Your mom just doesn't understand what you're going through and you need someone that can support you. Hell, even I'll do it and I don't even know you. Sorry if I am ranting, but I do just think that you need to find the right people that can help lift you up. My mother hasn't supported me in any of my depression and anxiety issues at all and it's the loneliest feeling in the world. That's why I turned to Reddit. So if you need support, you can talk to me. I don't judge. Ever.",2

I suffer depression but don't need the human contact as much as the next guy. Don't try to make one end all be all friend. You're putting too much pressure on them and yourself. You'll drive them away and crush yourself in the process. Be friendly and caring to all and just see who sticks around. Those are friends. Best friend? Don't look for one, be one.",2

Being sensitive makes your more empathetic (which is an amazing fucking quality to have!) and just really more in tune with the mood of the room. Do you know there are some people that just babble on and even ever tell that other stopped listening?? I know it sucks overthinking and constantly worrying.

9143,"Do you? Or are you still here asking for help and gathered the attention of your fellow Redditors and they are insisting they want to listen to you, but you keep denying them. I put it any other selfish. I used to give myself any excuse not to see my friends or family, but it was all debunked by the question they tell you themselves they felt that what I can tell, you really need to work on your negative speech patterns. All-or-nothing thinking, hopelessness, knee-jerk dismissals; these are all habits that depressed people make in their speech that perpetuate their own misery. It takes conscious effort to recognize our speech patterns as poisonous and slowly change not cares, you the one suffering. Recognize that your speech is under your control, and that cries for help can just as easily become lashing out. We love you, but loving us back involves making an effort not to give your worst ramblings air time.",2

I tried to think of them as living proof that Depression (personified for metaphor) was wrong about me. It told me nobody cares, nothing matters, if you died nothing would change. I showed it my mother and sister, and told it even if you see no value in me, others do. Basically, in my mind, I used my family as a logical check against the lies. Depression knows it is irrational; like a con man, it relies on persuasion rather than facts. But even when it takes over all of your other emotions, it can't take control of the emotions of others.",0

My boyfriend said this to me more frequently in the past and after YEARS of explaining why this is not a good response, he's slowly using it less, but when it pops up, my typical counter is That does not help me/make me feel better at all, and that typically shuts him up or at least makes him think about what he just said.

The common thing that happens is we trick ourselves into thinking alcohol = less The reality is that there is less of anything. There is less pain, but there is less joy, jealousy, curiosity, on the spectrum of sobriety, stone sober is at one side and unconscious is on the other side.  In other words, the more you drink, the close you move to passing out...which explains why you feel less the more you drink. This seems like not the worst thing in the word. But the problem lies in revisiting sobriety (which is why I call it an if The feelings return and feel stronger than before. This is often what promotes alcoholism. a perpetual escape from returning return of feeling.  This is not to demonize alcohol. Like I said, all about how used. Since, underage, I recommend it.

I was sad to be home, my parents were angry with me and told me all the terrible things they believed about me while I was gone. Things they heard from other people and things I think they imagined. About 80% were completely untrue. I was a disappointment and a sinner. I was sad to be away from my boyfriend and glad to be away from him at the same time. He was considerably older than I and of course I had envisioned our life together as different. The second time I ran away I had a better plan partly. I took my clothes and anything else I could throw in my friends car and went to her house where she lived with her grandparents. The next morning I woke up to my Step Mom standing at my feet telling me to get up and come with her and Dad. I grew up very depressed, my Mother passed away when I was 2 1/2 years old, then my older sister passed away few years later. Every day I was sad. I didn't understand what happened, I didn't understand how something so terrible could happen and life changed drastically and in a flash. No one talked to me about any of it and I was broken.

I do however think friends are important, although I have none in real life. If anyone at all tries to be your friend, I think you should try and be more open to making friends instead of like me. The last person that tried being friends with me I pushed away a lot and faked most of our friendship, but I regret that since he was willing to put in the effort so I think he deserves to have a good friendship.

I know the feeling, though can't be sure that's what you're worried about.  Maybe it's about meeting people? People can be stupid, demanding and stuff. Sometimes, even friends can feel like a burden to some people. Doesn't mean they hate their friends, it just drains them to constantly have to cater to their friends to keep them.  Maybe being in bed is just your favorite activity. You're addicted to it, just like people being addicted to video games. It makes you feel good to just lie there, as opposed to everything else.

9279,"I was diagnosed with it when I was 15, and I am 22 now. For my antidepressant, I tried lexapro ( which i stopped taking; because, it made my dick stop working), and wellbutrin.. which was alright. My antipsychotic was risperidone.. which I honestly am still dealing with a side affect of it till this day. I'll be honest, I took those combination of drugs for like 2.5 years, and just stopped. I learned how to deal with the symptoms a lot better than I did from years prior.. looking back.. thst could've gone poorly. I'd recommend being open in discussion with your psychiatrist about the effects these drugs are having on your body and your mood. There are quite a few drug combinations for this type of diagnosis, and it would be wise to work dilligently with your psychiatrist until you find the combination for you. Don't be afraid of them changing your meds. They aren't work anyway, so you may as well be open to working with professionals to find something that works for you and your body. I'd also recommend to try being aware as possible if the symptoms, the triggers for those symptoms, and look to grow from them even while on these medications. Keep a close eye out for unwanted side effects. A lot of the medicines they may try to prescribe would require regular schedules blood work. I'll be honest, I did the irresponsible thing and ended up just not taking them. I got tired of taking medicine at that point; because, I had been taking it all my life. Whether it was for childhood epilepsy, ADHD, depression, and the last diagnosis cyclothymia. Was hospitalized twice before I got the cyclothymia diagnosis, and it was pretty bad at one point, and looking back.. I'm really lucky I didn't mess myself up by just stopping cold turkey. Work with your psychiatrist and maybe even work with a therapist if you can. Do all you can do to find the proper treatment, and YOU WILL BE OKAY. You are not",2
9280,"One of my friends got better. Like, not just temporarily felt better, but like, actually got completely *better*. Honestly I was kind of shocked. I mean, I guess we all dream of someday getting better, but I'd never really heard of that actually happening before. She lost a ton of weight, got into a happy relationship, and has half a dozen dogs. And she's *normal* now. Like, not depressed or anxious anymore. She's happy. I'm really happy for her, not just because she's my friend and I'm glad she's not suffering anymore (although that's part of it), but also because it means that getting better really is possible and it's not just some made up dream. But at the same time I feel really awful and sad when I talk to her, because when I hear about how wonderfully her life is going now and how great she's doing, I feel like a worthless failure mentioning my own life. We used to bond over talking about how awful mental illness can be, and I felt like she was a light in the darkness, someone who was weathering the storm with me and who truly understood my pain. Now I feel ashamed because she's moved on and I haven't. I feel like bringing up how I feel now would only make her feel guilty and awkward.

Staying in bed awake for hours on weekdays, intentionally isolating myself or lying so I could be alone and mope. I stopped exercising and gained a ton of weight.  Hell I even had suicidal ideation and I just thought it was normal. I want to kill myself but I stop thinking about death and me dying. It sometimes felt like if I stopped existing it would be fine. I knew something was wrong but I was adamant it depression.  Then I went to my doctor thinking I had an anxiety problem and he began to ask THE questions. I knew he was trying to see if I had depression and it caught me by surprise. Of course I lied for most of them. It would be embarrassing; there was no way I was depressed, but the thought had worked its way in. Over the course of a year I did some idle research. I realized suicidal thoughts and a fascination with death are not normal. I matched a lot of my behavior to symptoms of depression. I came to accept it.

9300,"Youa re comdemned to a life of freedom. Is an old quote i tihnk its from satre, but im not sure. And later there has been others who disagree. You are forced to become alive and aware that much is for sure. Unlike most animals you are a creature born with the abillity gather information and draw conclusion not jsut based on your senses, and that oftens leads to the question. Why am i alive?  Not only that, you are forced into not just a world, but a particular part of the word, which then in turn will teach you values and conformaty, and for some people this works out well. If you can find it in yourself to look at the context you have born into and be satisfied with it, enjoy it and love it, if you can find shelter, food, sleep, joy, love and challenge in you enviroment. But for some of us, we don't fin those things, we suddenly find ourself in a enviroment that conflicts with our nature, the context of our existence is not operationable with the essence of our nature.  You first statement i cannot, say is wrong, you didn't decide to exist, but netiher did you chose not to. And existing in of itself is not evil or good. But if the context of your life is making your life or nature feel haunted and painful. Then a there are options available. The first thing, no matter how you want to change your context for the better, rquires that you step back and see the context.  Where are you from, what values have been impsoed on you, which makes sense to you which doesn't, how has these values been imposed, who has impsoed them. For these purposes your reasoning is a great tool. It easy to finda figure head or a single person to blame, but you really have to map it out, and see udnerstand ana analyse your einvirotment and the people in it, and then find the conflicts with your nature, the pain and sadness.  Then you have to figure out a plan. And this is a tremendous task, not just do you have to think thoguhts you ahve not been taught to think, you have to be critical of a system that raised you and shaped you. You have to go against the nature of what normal is and accept yourself. And then you ahve to find out how you want to change the context of your life.  alkohol amkes me miserable, and everyone i know drinks Find people you can exist with with out alcohol  My father is violent Create an existence were you are independant from him  School is terrible translate My class mates bully me daily Find another school  thes are simple i know, and jsut examples. Now i know you asked why do i have to do all this hard work and i threw some of the most difficult work and ideas at you. But the things is all what ive jsut said is the reasonalbe arguemtn for you nature, essence and existence and a way to improve it.  when you ask why, reason is not a tool that can answer. its like trying to build a ship using lead, sure maybe it can be done, but its deffinately not the best way.  Refelection, abstract thought, contemplation, emotion, empathy. those are the tools to arrive at an answer.  If reason was used, human life wouldn't really have value. If you were the head of state and only used reason, you would quickly realize, human lives are not what drives you foward, what makes progress and creates a super power. And lives could turn into numbers. Sure educated people anda strong work force is good reasonable arguments to have a population, but only if they are educated or strong. Using reason to determine worth of life can lead to terrible ideas or no answers.  You have to work hard right now, because you are worth it depsise allt he pain you are in you are worth it, and you deserve to be your best you. And if you don't liek working 8 hours a day then sleep 8 hours and then have 8 hours for yourself. Then there are options, but because you born into this context you ahve to work hard to get to those oprions. It is hard to change your enviroment.  You have to stay alive becuase, you know a humans life has worth and you are one. When you see another in pain you wish he wouldn't ahve to be, when i see your words and want to help you but am incapable i still try. You have worth because of all the thigns you have not done yet, and all the people who have not enjoyed you future self.  Stay strong friend  Love  I wish i speleld better",0

9303,"That's a pretty profound question, but I think happiness is something that a lot of people don't understand. In a period or prolonged period of despair, I don't believe there can be happiness at all, and it's only after that period has been solved, over, attacked enough by effort and time, that you can start experiencing happiness. I don't think happiness and gratitude should be forced, or you should try to feel happy when you truly cannot feel happy. I'm still going through that period, and there might be rivets or jewels of happiness along the way, but they are fleeting and leave very quickly. The whole reason why people despair is because they are tied so strongly to negative emotional memories that they outweigh any trivial positive emotional memories. Think about it, which memories are the quickest, strongest, and most easily able to be remembered for you? The most emotional ones. If your most emotional memories are negative, you will be in despair. On the converse, if one's most emotional memories are positive, you will be in a state of happiness. There is a way to end your despair, you just have to face it head on and let go of everything, and keep trying to let go and accept. Very few people have any science on this and might be the thing we need to explore the most as a society as a whole.",2

On bad days the dog is giant and weighing you down and on better days the dog is small and at your feet. This helped me accept a lot more about my life and my depression rather than constantly wishing it could just go away. I would get so mad at myself for being angry/sad but now I know it's like owning an animal--you take care of it and it won't bite you, at least not as much anyway. It's part of who you are and that is okay. I do not have severe depression so I am not on meds, so can't speak for those folks who are, but for me exercise and doing things for me (rather than constantly for others or other people's approval) really helped. It's like learning to be selfish in a good way. Eating less carbs and gluten helped too as they tended to make my body more sluggish which did t help when I already felt sad/slow/tired. I eat a lot more protein and fresh veggies now and I think there is a big difference--especially after 6+ months. I still drink alcohol but now a limited variety of stuff that I truly like the flavor of rather than eh it's here so I'll drink it. Also I don't drink when I'm in a bad place or anything traumatic happened that day/week. It's just a recipe for bad. I don't do any other drugs and I'm allergic to smoke so can't speak on that.

9327,"Exercise has always helped when I am as you said. If you would do anything to feel better, then muster everything you have for high intensity exercise. At least 45 minutes for three time per week. I get it, the last thing you want to do is exercise, but if you will do anything to get out of it, just do it.",2
9328,"Get up and take a shower, and then go for a walk so you can clear your mind. That usually helps me after going through one of these periods. It sucks, but you'll get through it.

9350,"Hey, I know how you feel. Sometimes it's hard to handle daily responsibilities when you're depressed. Everyone fucks up dude. (A practice that is helpful albeit uncomfortable is closing my eyes and breathing, imagining the place that I dread returning to, and picturing myself sitting in there, breathing and at peace. Then I zoom out to the building and picture all the rooms filled with all the other students.. Then I zoom out and picture the exterior... I zoom out and imagine the city view, then the state, then the country, then the hemisphere, then the whole planet, suspended in the I stay there and I just watch it spin slowly. And This puts into perspective that my mistake cannot defeat me.)    I flunked out of college my freshman year and still haven't had the courage to go back, so I commend you for trying again.    And as unsolicited as this is, I gotta say I disagree with the polarizing statement that there isn't anything you can do. You can own your mistake, which you already have. You can brush yourself off and see the mistake in the context of the rest of your life (which is priceless and you are worth so much.) And you can try to do better tomorrow. You are only human. Try and keep your chin up, buddy. (edit* for clarity)",2
9351,"I can only recommend fiction (apologies; not much of a self-help/non-fiction kind of guy) but The Perks of Being a Wallflower (the film; never read the book myself) deals with depression among other things and is very powerful. Much of Sylvia Plath's poetry centres around mental health and depression, if that's of interest, and while it's not something I've read 'The Bell Jar' (which is prose) is also supposed to be very good, according to a former acquaintance of mine. And I recently finished watching an anime called Orange which was mostly very good at dealing with the issue, the one caveat being that characters tend to talk about 'saving' people quite a lot, which can be a little bit galling (lol). Music-wise, Brand New have done a number of songs which either deal with depression (or emotions that can be closely linked to depression) or are pretty evocative in that sense tonally-speaking. Can't think of anything else right off the top of my head but hopefully that's a fair amount of stuff, in the short-term at least",0

9354,"I've never done it, but I've seen people do it, usually with 5 or 6 dogs, they have apps and websites for walking or pet sitting. It might take a month to build some clients, but the hours are flexible and you pretty much get to be your own boss, and pet dogs all day The main thing is to choose something you enjoy, it will feel much less soul killing, and will come naturally, rather than feeling like you're fighting to survive.",2
9355,"Ugh, you are absolutely right; the world and humans are a mess. This might not make you feel better but it has always been a mess. It actually isn't really much worse than it has always been. I read a certain amount of history and have come to realize this. Even if you just read the Old Testament you can see how crappy people were. One thing that helps me is to stay away from news. I don't think it makes us informed if all we know is the bad stuff. Also try subscribing and reading Uplifting News on a regular basis. Made Me Smile is also a good. Finally to really get informed about the good stuff going on in the world, volunteer. I prefer Habitate for Humanity; you meet people from all walks of life doing what little they can to help others.

9358,"The same advice applies to them in one regard. Need to know sadness to really be happy. It sucks that depression is part of my life, but it gives my character a unique value that is missing in others. Still would rather feel good without falling back into the void every time.",2

Idk if that even made any sense but hey have an internet hug buddy the least I could do,2
9381,"Been there... but can I give a really cool trick that might truly help? When looking for a job, try to find a new store/restaurant/place opening up. No matter what it is... It was my trick back into the work force because when a place is just opening, everyone is new and everyone is learning so all in it together, instead of walking into an established place where people already know what doing and have friends etc... anyway, what worked for me in the end. Either way, keep trying. Taking it one step at a time.. fill out applications and if you get phone calls set up interviews. If you get too anxious and go then go, but maybe one day have that little extra burst of energy and go. And if you start working and like it, ok, you can look elsewhere. So just keep pushing along.",2

9384,Brilliant. I sat here and mulled it over. I really like it.,0
9385,"You know what kind of answer you'll get here. I know this is your state of mind right now, but realize that it is a state of mind. You want to take some kind of action to change your circumstances and right now suicide seems like the only option. That's because taking some kind of action to change your circumstances helps lift your brain out of its depression. Suddenly you don't feel completely hopeless. Maybe life can be better after all... Except you'd be having that thought as you're dying. That would be terrible. So you have to find some other way to turn things around.",2

Seeing a doctor and getting antidepressants is the first step. The second step is finding something, ANYTHING, to get out of bed for. For me it was my cat. I would go without eating for days because I didn't want to leave my house, and I didn't want a delivery man to see the state of my house and myself. When my cat ran out of food I would suck it up and go to the store so he wouldn't be hungry. When he curled up with me I felt good, at a time that nothing else felt good. He passed a few months ago, but he flat out saved my life and I'm constantly grateful. Life can be overwhelming, especially when you feel the way you do. But you can make it better.

9421,"Hi friend! :) I'm really sorry you're in such pain :( sometimes the people we have around us can't see the pain we're in because they don't want to (they may see it, not know how to help us, and are afraid to because it may cause them pain). This may seem like useless advice, but it can greatly help if you tell the other people exactly how you're feeling and ask them to try and help you. Nobody will ever be inside your head and able to experience exactly what you are feeling, but by talking to them and letting them know, you can help them to understand you. Sometimes we have to do the hardest part of reaching out ourselves. I had to tell my best friend I was feeling suicidal, but by telling her she helped me turn my life around. She just didn't realise. It's never easy to do, but I can promise you that you are so much stronger than you know, and there are always people willing to listen and to try to understand what you're going through. Lastly, I hope you don't die. Not until you've been able to live the life that you want, the life that you deserve to have. I'm sending you love and luck.",2
9422,"I looked at your post history(sorry, I'm nosy) and what caught my eye was that you were upset that you feel girls don't find you attractive. The key there was you said you don't even bother talking to them. A fear of rejection is what keeps most people single, I think. Even just smiling at a girl when she walks by might make you feel better. If she gives you that, What do you want, weirdo? look, that's her insecurity, and those aren't the kind of people you want in your life anyways. Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder. My problem is the opposite, I'm skinny as a rail and short. Upon putting myself out there, I found that some people actually think I'm attractive. You're your own worst critic, so I sincerely doubt your just un-lovably ugly. And about your weight, treat it like an RPG, make a game of losing weight. You'll start to feel better about yourself the more you lose. It can be kind of fun to work on yourself, especially when you start to see results. I was talking to my parents the other day, and calorie counting apparently worked wonders on them. Do some research and see what's best for you, I'm no doctor. Hope this helps.",2

Maybe because in the end of all of this, there is a light at the end of the tunnel. Last night I had an incredibly suicidal episode; I've hurt myself in the past as well. And while I don't know how you feel personally, I can relate. When I feel the way I do, it's really hard to try and see the world around me. Your mom just doesn't understand what you're going through and you need someone that can support you. Hell, even I'll do it and I don't even know you. Sorry if I am ranting, but I do just think that you need to find the right people that can help lift you up. My mother hasn't supported me in any of my depression and anxiety issues at all and it's the loneliest feeling in the world. That's why I turned to. So if you need support, you can talk to me. I don't judge. Ever.",2
9426,"It certainly doesn't hurt, given that you tell someone who is halfway decent. I find it to be a huge relief when I can talk to someone about it.

She lost a ton of weight, got into a happy relationship, and has half a dozen dogs. And she's *normal* now. Like, not depressed or anxious anymore. She's happy.  I'm really happy for her, not just because she's my friend and I'm glad she's not suffering anymore (although that's part of it), but also because it means that getting better really is possible and it's not just some made up dream. But at the same time I feel really awful and sad when I talk to her, because when I hear about how wonderfully her life is going now and how great she's doing, I feel like a worthless failure mentioning my own life. We used to bond over talking about how awful mental illness can be, and I felt like she was a light in the darkness, someone who was weathering the storm with me and who truly understood my pain. Now I feel ashamed because she's moved on and I haven't. I feel like bringing up how I feel now would only make her feel guilty and awkward.  It feels like as my friends start to get better and move on with their lives while I remain stuck here making no progress, there's no longer any place for me.",2

9450,"I find that how you view failure is tied to your expectations quite heavily. Or also the pressure of feeling others' expectations of you on your shoulders. I still haven't worked things out that I'm able to effectively handle failure myself, but mainly people can feel better when they fail, because they recognise it as a learning experience, or it is an inevitable part of the process. Now this may sound obvious, but when in the moment, it is very easy to forget this and lose sight of progress after the failure. Failure can appear in many forms. My expectation of a 'good outcome', instead was a horrible mistake... Or was it? I'm sorry to hear you feeling even worse after your suicide attempt. Just know that I believe you are alive, and fighting, and you will come out of this stronger.",2

None is expecting you to be the fastest person in the race, we just want you to keep moving forward with us. A good goal is something achievable. On my broken days, my goals are to get up, take a shower, make a bowl of cereal. I'm a bit luckier than most, I have a wonderful wife and child, and they help me out when it comes to keeping myself moving forward.  Just tiny things should be your goal. Eat an apple. Stretch.

9463,"sorry to hear that, but been in a similar situation after taking some time off of school. My best advice is to take the minimum amount of classes possible so you get too overwhelmed. For me essential to plan my assignments in advance, so that I can just do things one by one and not let it all get piled up cuz then I wanna die. Also, if you need a break, take one. School will always be there but good to take care of yourself too :)",2

9467,"not really a form of depression, but it can definitely be a symptom of it. Feeling that you are worthless, a burden, a failure, are all very common to those suffering from depression. What separates it from simply having low self esteem, which many people do, are whether or not you have the other symptoms associated with depression. Things like lack of energy and interest, hopelessness about the future, difficulty sleeping/eating/focusing, suicidal thoughts; experiencing these things on a consistent basis for weeks/months/years is definitely indicative of some sort of depression. Take some time and think about how you feel and been causing it, Do some research into your thoughts and what others say about it. If you decide you need or want help, be afraid to reach out to others and communicate your troubles. I wish you the best of luck, you got this.",2
9468,"Maybe she just didn't know how to react to it... or just in shock. i think you should see a therapist because it seems that you're a danger to yourself or you could talk to a close friend about your suicidal thoughts. There's more to life than people's validation about you, trust me. It really gets better overtime. Bad thoughts will come and it will pass, you need to find support of others to overcome it.",2

9473,I'm locked in a viscous cycle between my physical and mental illnesses. Been diagnosed with major depressive disorder for close to 5 years now. About 2 years ago I developed a movement disorder. It has been documented but not yet diagnosed as doctors haven't figured out anything about it. The depression triggers the non epileptic seizures which cause major disturbances in my life. Crippling my quality of life and reducing what I can do. This feeds into my depression. More negative mental health the worse and more frequent the seizure like symptoms happen. Also have bad tremors and ticks in relation to the non epileptic seizures. I often fall down and have issues walking and standing. Can barely leave my home. Am reduces to limit movement inside my home which has caused weight gain from decrease movements which also stregnthens my depression which in return causes more seizure like episodes. No medication helps my mental or physical health. It actually worsens both. I am going without treatment because doctors refuse to take it seriously or are completely dumbfounded. It has been over a year since anything was prescribed to attempt to help me. Seen several specialist. This terrible cycle has lead me to multiple suicide attempts in the last few months.,2

There are times though that I can feel the dark clouds approaching but they're much easier to handle, and the lows are more evened out to what I guess would be considered a normal level.",2

It is good that you have some long term friendship. short term friendship is not bad too.   Dont know if you do this or not. A mistake i made is that I used to watch a lot of comedy. Comedians would make a lot of self deprecating jokes, they would say things like : nobody likes them, they are unattractive, got terrible personalities, they have messed up life, blablabla in a very funny way. And i actually took it serious (by this i dont mean i get offend by jokes ) And proud that i am relate to that. So i always lookdown on myself.

The first thing you should do is to find out the top three things, basically your skills that you are good at and which can help you in some way for getting online jobs. 2. Make a list of such jobs that you can opt for as per your top three skill-sets. 3. The next thing is to look for free or paid online resources to learn about that job and start applying. I would suggest starting with some easy job that you can find without any trouble. For instance, you can do data entry in the beginning. After a few months, you can start doing transcription work, and then maybe move on to become a virtual assistant. So in this way, you will ultimately start earning a decent earning on your own.

It often feels like we are just vehicles of pain who live so that others don't suffer from grief should we commit suicide. As we develop a greater sensitivity to the cost of mental illness, policies and social norms will change: Some countries now allow for euthanasia for those with chronic and unbearable mental illness. But what's strange about all of this is, even though I'm certain I have the right to kill myself because I'm miserable everyday, I am pulling for you to live, even though you're a stranger on the internet.

Sometimes we all have to fake the way we are in order to get where we need to be, or get to what we want.

Then at the end of the day, satisfying the expectation is underwhelming--dissatisfying to its core. Then we just think, ok, now what?  Just this post is poetic enough to make me think that you've got some fancy talents locked up in that head of yours.

9564,"Yes, I have. Currently I am a mess. Nevertheless there used to be a time when I was a mess, but still had a reason to pick myself up and get my shit done. If you want to study and pass your exams, this is what I did: - Get busy studying now (within 15 minutes). No excuses to eat/drink a bit. Not going to the bathroom. Just study. Phone away. If possible laptop/computer away. Do this for at least one hour and take a small break to get fresh air if you want and drink some water. NO PHONE. Then back to studying. Again one hour or more. - After studying go for a run (I don't care if it is 11 pm) or exercise in some other way. - Eat healthy. You crave good tasting food? chocolate? chips? No go. When you go to the supermarket, fast food is not an option. You will not spend your money on that shit. No chips, no sweet stuff, no special drinks. Fruit/vegetables/carbs/meat/fish/bread/milk/yoghurt. Healthy stuff. Lots of water. - Go to bed on time. Get out of bed on time. - No thinking! Only actions. - Do one thing at a time. No thinking about tomorrow or the next hours. Just about the next minute. What are you going to do now? Shower? check. Dress? check. Breakfast? check. Go to library? check. Study one hour? check. Have a small break and drink water? check. continue. - If possible, study with other people - (added) When I get stuck, it has been VERY helpful for me to discuss this with other students. This has been very difficult for me, because I have a crazy amount of pride and am very ashamed of showing I do not understand something. Nonetheless, it has helped me so much to just discuss a problem where i got stuck with someone and then see the light which enables me to continue studying (instead of procrastinating till everything went to shit). This doesn't solve the deeper problems, but it probably will get you through your exams as good as possible. At least, this is how I managed to finish my undergraduate years. Not healthy, but it worked. Also you will probably find that by being so hard for yourself, setting boundaries and actually following them, you will start to feel a lot better about yourself and gain confidence. This is a trap, do not get satisfied with yourself. Being satisfied and giving yourself more space to slightly cross your boundaries again is equal to getting on the slide that will get you right back into the pit. This became a rant, hope it helps you in some way.",0

It's not about getting a certain grade for social life, or any other aspect of life for that matter. You are not a failure. Not having friends worsens depression, depression inhibits the ability to make friends. It's a cycle that needs to be broken, and I recommend getting medical help to tackle depression. Eventually you will get to a point where it is easier to make/maintain relationships, even if it that progress seems small at first. Keep up the fight.",2
9580,"Yeah, this feeling is a strong one. Felt it consistently for a lot of my childhood and early adulthood. The truth is that I never dealt with it constructively, or at least in a way that could help me get to the root of that feeling. Part of the reason I think you and I are on this in the first place is because we were never taught how to deal with that feeling constructively. In my case, I used constant denial and self-numbing ... At some point, I just assumed the pit was a part of me I could choose to ignore. You seem to be actively trying to experience it. You are engaging your sadness, which is objectively good for working through depression. It may not be what you might call 'conventional' but everyone does their thing a little differently :) If what you are doing no longer works for you though, it might be best to start looking for other (healthy) ways of working through that discomfort. Personally, when I feel that pit, I know what thoughts tend to follow it. Fortunately, my therapists (and my stay at hospital) helped me come up with ways to attack that pit when it hit me hard. In order to redirect those thoughts that create it, I try to reach out to anyone in my support net. It's hard because I feel like they won't give a shit, but most of the time, they do (but I often choose to ignore that reality). Or I will simply write some positive words here, on this. Reaching out to others here in positive ways is not just for others, but for my own sake as well. As you put so well, giving that pit a 'purpose'. But don't cover that feeling up. Continue to engage with it, as best as you can. It's there for a reason. Hopefully, the more you work with it, the easier it is to process and let go.",2

9591,"Yup, my therapist described this to me as a triangle: Thoughts fuel feelings which fuel our interactions which fuel thoughts. She said that the only way to escape the loop was to break one of the parts. Obviously breaking interactions would just put on a facade, so she suggested breaking either thoughts by changing perception to be more of what she called rational, (through looking at the ups and downs of any situation instead of deciding based just on the downs) or breaking feelings by re-evaluating them using a similar method.  &amp;nbsp;  I've always unknowingly found myself back in the loop over and over again, but what I would do in your situation would be to look at things objectively, put a self-aware lens over your life, see what you can do to make it better and make choices from there.",2

9600,"Hi Talk2muchaa,  Lik onus111 suggested, 'feeling like doing something' just does not happen. If you're deeply unhappy with a lack of activity in your life, you just need to force yourself to do it - That's the sad reality of it. HOWEVER, that doesn't mean that there aren't ways to make FORCING yourself 'easier' on your mind and less stressful. If you want to build a house consisting of a 1000 bricks, take 30 seconds a day to lay 3 bricks and in one year, you will have a house.  You can't punish yourself for not building Rome in a day. You will go on Twitch and see streamers who are making millions... YouTubers who are making millions. I mean fuck, PewDiePie has 56 million subscribers.  But that shit didn't happen in just one day. You need to break shit up into increments. Perhaps others don't have to do this. But it's the only way I've found to get anything done. If you want to learn a language, go on Duolingo. Set a '10 points per day' challenge. Yes, it's jack-shit in terms of work. It takes literally 2 minutes a day, BUT- it's something.  Try and ignore your brain saying Increase the goal to 50 a day, we're getting fuck-all done because this will break your discipline and you'll go back to 0 a day.  Consistently doing 10 a day for 11 days, is better than doing 50 a day for 2 days, burning out and stopping altogether. The key to beating depression-induced laziness is TINY, incremental steps. For example, I'm learning Calculus on Khan Academy. One. Lesson. A Day.  That's right- the average Khan video is around 10 minutes. I do one video a day. I am slowly, but consistently learning. Each day I go over the notes from the previous day. The problem isn't volume- it's consistency.",0

So the practical thing for me to do would be to relax and be aware of my tendencies to fall victim to my emotions which in turn produce thoughts that are self destructive and wasting my time.  See to be emotional is irrationality and far from practical. Take some time out and just breathe and let the shit go...you got this. you are right now...literally and I want to fall into those emotions and spread the way I feel everywhere. I want those who love me to know and those who hate me to know more but in the f u kinda way.

I need a balance of alone time and time with friends to start feeling like myself again, and if I get that balance wrong I can meltdown. I tend to downplay my problems to the people around me and upplay them to strangers. For example, inflate things for the sake of a conversation with some crisis volunteer or something, just to get some free sympathy and support that I have to feel weird about later because I see that person again. But, if a friend asks me how doing, my first reaction is to reply I have good friends so they call me out on this. I self sabotage by missing appointments or shutting out natural light. If cold, thirsty, hungry or uncomfortable, I ignore it and let myself suffer. I know getting better when I start doing certain things for myself. If I make myself some tea or get more blankets or sit somewhere other than my bed, I tell myself because I care about myself and want to feel better. I have physical pain associated with depression, usually I feel an ache in my arms and legs. When I have the energy I stretch to alleviate it. This also helps me feel better. I have to be conscious of whether I have the energy to do something, because if I force myself I could get overwhelmed and just sink further down. had to learn to say no to people when what they ask of me is more than I can provide without suffering later. But, for the most part, learned my depression will leave when good and ready. been going downhill for two months and had a meltdown a few nights ago so been thinking a lot about what I really need to get through these times. These depressed phases tend to last 4-6 months for me so still got a long way to go. This my first rodeo, though, prepared. learned that there are plenty of little things I can do that feel like self care. Self care is not always an elaborate bath with essential oils and red wine. To me self care is getting up to make a cup of tea, spending a couple minutes stretching, or ordering food when hungry instead of waiting until everything is closed and starving. It have to make you feel better all at once, but all those little things add up, and it means more when you put conscious value on it. will stretch so my body hurt so much, and I do this because I care about feeling I say to myself.

9649,"Because of your depression or your partners?   My ex broke up with me because of hers. At the time she said she still loved me but needed to get better (really true, she was a nutcase). We recently talked after a few months of NC and her getting leveled out on anti-depressants. Her hurt was not the same as mine. Her emotions were flat-lined. Anhedonia. The sadness, anger, frustration, confusion, despair that I felt are emotions she was incapable of feeling. I know this because I was severely depressed myself years ago. Even now since she is on SSRI's, and with it being months later, I don't think her hurt is even close to what mine was. I think her hurt is more in regret. I honestly doubt she will ever truly hurt over this breakup - by the time she's off the meds and capable of feeling those raw emotions again, it will probably be a total of 1-2 years since the breakup. She'll only have to deal with regret - if even that.   Of course some cynical side of me wants her to feel what I did. I want her to grieve the loss of our relationship like I did. I want her to think about what we had, let those good memories fill her with the positive emotions we had together, and have them followed up by sadness over the realization she lost it. But when I really think about it, I know I don't want that to happen. She cried enough when she started sinking lower into depression. The outbursts, the frustration, the fear of losing me. I remember how much that happened. She hurt too, it just happened for months before the breakup, where mine was after.",2

I find it helpful to seal away any self-detrimental desires inside characters who are not me. If you purge all of your thoughts out of your head and onto the page, you might find some relief. Literature is one of the most important inventions for resolving issues and you may find purpose through writing for yourself. My life is not pleasant by any means so I created the life that I want in my writing. My life became better through writing. What ideas and notions could be lost if you left us so soon? What adventures could you go on in your own book? Think of all the memories that could be shared. You could even write about a role-model. Mine is Typhon, the Greek dragon under the mountain. I obsess over this mad titan to keep myself calm. He shows up in all of my work. My advice would be to pound that pain out into a character, a mighty simulacrum, an indestructible artifact to contain your every fear.

9658,"Pretending to be happy can be extremely hard, no matter if depressed or not. Sure, depression doesn't make it any easier, thats a fact. Do you have someone you can talk to? For example have a really deep conversation, tell them about your biggest fears? Where you dont have to pretend to be happy? Wearing a mask is exhausting as hell, and the longer you try to keep it up, the more explosive will it be, when you can't hold it up any longer. In that regard, I speak from experience. And last but not least, it's completely fine to not feel happy sometimes. You just have to feel sad, out of the loop, neglected, rejected or even hated sometimes. Those are the moments where you really analyze yourself and your doings, (something you should keep under control, because too much of it is destructive), and if you embrace it, roll with it, telling yourself that this is natural and just a response of something inside you, you can't really pinpoint yet, those times could actually end up being beneficial for you. Noone feels 100% happy all the time, and if so, I'd call them liars. If you want, shoot me a pm, anytime! Keep your head up! please!",2

Find any average girl in her late twenties or older, and they'll likely be able to tell you some things they did to dudes they weren't proud of after the fact, but at the time, seemed like the most sane and logical thing, something they needed to do. Guys do the same, just in a different manner. On both sides, it hurts like hell, and is something everyone goes through.  Focus on yourself. Not the Tony Robbins rah-rah go you!

But once I'm there, I'm often the Life of the Party, or so I think. I had people coming up to me, greeting me by my name and telling me how much fun they had last time we had met each other. Which was a year ago. For the first and last time since. I barely remembered their faces and not a single name. So I guess I left an impression. I really like to banter, to do play on words and take words from their mouth and turn them around in a fun way. I joke and tell stories with expressive facial expressions and big gestures. I'm sarcastic, sometimes even cynical. And I joke a lot about myself, mostly in a non-flattering way. I think people like me in general, I seldomly had someone outright refuse to interact with me. But on the other hand, as soon as I come home, I feel a crushing void and I feel alone and that everything is pointless. Those feelings remain in my day-to-day life. And it starts to interfere with my work, for example. I am not one to contain my feelings in an enviroment where I spend most of my days and life in. My boss already told me once, in a pretty long phase of being really depressed, that even my collegues said that something must be seriously wrong and the have no fun working around and with me if I'm in such mood. I can be fun at work, too. I made my co-workers laugh on a lot f different occasions. But that happens in good phases. But there are very bad phases where I, at best, don't say a single word all day unless absolutly necessary and at worst, I am filled with rage the whole day and can't contain it. Last week I was as close to quitting my job as I was never before. Maybe it would be best for all.  Whatever, long story short: I think I can be really funny, too.

I used to be depressed over my bad grades and I had this constant anxious feeling that my life was over because of these bad grades and I would amount to nothing.  Then all of a sudden one day, I noticed that bad grades in high school aren't the end of the world. It might have been because I moved out of my Dad's place and I didn't have to hear him call me a failure anymore. Either way, I became happy again.  Then I met her. A nice girl who was my age. She had a pretty face, we had a ton of classes together, and she thought I was really funny. I was able to open up to her. I think (I know) I fell in love with her. She had a boyfriend though. He's a shitty person. He's high all the time and he always flirts around with other girls.  I really thought she would break it off with him and find her way to my arms and I'd be the happiest guy in the world. That didn't happen. I became desperate. I began to have a drinking problem because of it. One night while very drunk I texted her a bunch of things about my depression. I don't think she cares about me anymore. Now I find myself drunk and alone for the umpteenth time wondering how I let myself get depressed again.   Basically what I wanna say to you is: your life's not over, it's just beginning. Whatever it is that makes you feel like a failure is probably a problem that is possible to overcome. Just focus on you and don't let other people get in your way and bring you down like I did.

9723,"I saw your post several hours ago and I've been thinking all afternoon about what you asked. I'm not sure if I can fully explain the shift I made from being depressed and suicidal to the generally happy person I am now. There was a whole series of decisions and lessons and realizations I've made over a period of several years which probably merits its own post (or series of them). I joined this a short time ago and have been sort of lurking, trying to understand this community and seeing if I have anything to contribute, and your post makes me realize that maybe just telling my story will help others make their own way on their journey. To answer your specific question, the one thing I have come to understand is that there really isn't going to be a time when you are entirely done with it. There will always be a chance, however small, that you can fall back into it. However the longer you go without falling back in, the easier it gets. I tend to think of it in terms of black holes and orbital bodies. I'm going to have to create a post on that. The truths I've found is that recovery and freedom from depression is about breaking habitual negative lines of thought by replacing it with more positive ones. It's about learning how to recognize when you are falling back into the pit of depression, and being able to pull yourself back out. It's about accepting and finding value in yourself, and finding many many reasons to continue to be alive, to contribute and interact with the rest of the world. Coming from the other side, I understand so many things that I used to see as negative really don't have any sort of positive or negative connotation. That was all in my head. Often those negative connotations were put there by others, sometimes inadvertently, sometimes deliberately. I had to learn how to strip those ideas off and choose a new set of ideas to assign. I learned how to identify what kind of ideas were worth keeping and using, and which ones were not and discard them. I know this doesn't really explain much how I see things now, and how I no longer feel depressed all the time, but I promise to share my story in the hopes of helping you understand how I got where I am, and maybe help you make a similar journey.",0
9724,"To answer your question, I'm actually feeling alright today. Had an existential crisis last night and probably would have ended up killing myself or at the very least cutting myself if it wasn't for my dog licking my hand as I layed in bed crying myself to sleep (she's NEVER an affectionate dog, it took me a minute to even realise that she was actually licking my hand and I wasn't imagining shit). Thanks, Charlie. Anyways, for me depression is like absolute insanity. It's not just sadness or feeling like killing myself every other week. Just pure insanity. The best example I can give is probably two years ago, seventh grade. That was probably the lowest I had ever been. Every night when I went to sleep, I'd stay up on my phone. Not because I wanted to be, because it kept me from going to sleep and having the same nightmares I had every night. And then I'd look at the time, which by now was probably about 12 AM, realise how absolutely sad and pathetic I was and turn on some emo music, usually being something like Set it Off's I'll Sleep When I'm Dead and listen to that as I (literally) sadistically laugh and cry myself to sleep. Some nights, that kind of stuff never happened. I'd have a peaceful sleep. Some nights I'd stay up all night debating whether I should text the suicide hotline, doing so, and it being no help whatsoever. So I'd get, maybe six hours of sleep at most. Before I'm woken up and have to get ready for school. How am I woken up? By my parents during the best part of my dream or the most peaceful part of my nightmare. Which already started my day off terribly. Then for an hour I'd be in the bathroom once again listening to emo music as I let the shower water run. My favourite songs to listen to were usually just about anything by Hollywood Undead. Not something a twelve year old should be listening to, sure. But it was a way to cope with my depression. As I listen to those songs, once again sadistically laughing at my own pain and often times end up cutting myself. I never cut myself deep, I was far to afraid of doing that. But... I enjoyed seeing the blood come out. I didn't cut for any sort of high or release of pain. It was sort of hard to explain. I was never addicted to cutting, I could stop or start whenever I wanted. Sometimes stopping for months at a time, but seeing the blood, made me feel happy. If you could have seen my eyes, especially when I cut myself, you wouldn't have seen any traces of a twelve year old. You'd see an insane person desperately trying to grasp on to the last straw of sanity, but nothing else. Some days I'd debate whether I should do a sort of murder-suicide thing. Or at the very least murder those who have caused me pain and suffering. Sometimes I'd have very and scarily elaborate plans on how I'd trick, kidnap, or kill my family. Things that you'd never expect from a twelve year old. But quite frankly, I might have physically been twelve, but my depression had probably aged and matured me way faster. The ride to school was probably the most traumatic for me. The ride was only about ten minutes (five minutes to school, five minutes in the carpool line). But those ten minutes were full of tests streaming down my face, me punching myself or ripping my hair out, or destroying my notebooks or pencils. Sometimes because I just really didn't want to go to school. Sometimes because my social anxiety got the best of me. Sometimes for reasons I don't even know. Me and my grandma would usually sit at the front of the school for about an hour or two, I'm sitting there trying to find a way to hurt myself because I'm angry, but don't want to let my anger out on her, and she's crying because she's absolutely lost on how to help me. I'd usually end up getting to school about a good three hours late. In school, I don't remember anything. Maybe it's because I was just walking around the school like a robot. Class for an hour, find your next class, repeat. In class, I'd have my head down in a book (not paying attention to the teacher whatsoever), I'd be mindlessly reciting the emo songs I listen to in my head, or I'd be talking to my friend AIDEN. (Yes, his name is in all caps). What I do definitely remember is hating all of my peers. Hell, I still hate them. It's not my hatred for them itself. It's just I can't stand how immature, idiotic, and stupid they were. Like who the hell goes around sticking Tide pods in their mouths for views on social media? Or who thinks it's funny to go around telling people to kill themselves because you heard your favourite edgy YouTuber say it and now you think it's hilarious to do so. Or why do you think it's cool and okay to curse every five seconds and use the N-word? Or why do you think that because you saw Kim Kardashian half naked in some photo shoot that you can show up to school with hardly any clothes on or sag and talk about fucking whores because your favourite rapper said it in their newest song? Act your own god damn age, quit trying to act like someone three times your age while being as immature as a kindergartener. More on AIDEN: AIDEN sort of just appeared out of nowhere. I don't know when or why I came up with him, I just sort of did. I'm not schizophrenic, he was 100% my own voice talking back to me in my head, but I enjoyed pretending to have someone to talk to. Someone who walked around with me everyday, knew exactly what I was thinking, and could relate to me all the time. Someone who (though was just my own voice), talked me out of suicide many times back in 7th grade. But slowly I started treating AIDEN a lot more like a real person. To the point where I could have easily been mistaken as someone with schizophrenia. At home I'd just go into my room and basically lock myself in. My door was never locked, my parents could come in and out as they pleased, but I would just hand out under the covers all day. I didn't want to see light, light didn't want to see me. I didn't bother with homework. I figured, I fail, I fail. I really had just given up with life at that point. The only reason why I hadn't killed myself was probably because I was too sad and lazy to bother trying. Occasionally I'd talk to AIDEN or watch YouTube or something, but most times I ended up listening to hypnosis. Hypnosis for me was like a way to escape real life. Like meditation, but instead of being left alone with my sad and depressing thoughts, I could listen to someone else. At first it was a nice little escape, but then it more or less because an addiction. An odd strange one that I'd never be able to explain to anyone, but an addiction none the less. I'd try to listen to hypnosis any time I could even if that meant going into my room away from family to listen to it. It kind of gave me the same high that cutting, smoking, drugs, or porn give other people. Even though it was just hypnosis, it really did become unhealthy. Before I knew it, it was time for me to go to bed. And then the whole cycle would repeat itself over and over and over and over and over again. It was the same routine, same schedule, same insanity over and over again. This sounds like more is going on than just depression, right? Like some other underlying mental illness. But this is all depression and a bit of social anxiety. No MPD, no schizophrenia, no bipolar disorder, I'm not a psychopath or sociopath. This was all thanks to my depression. No one actually knew how bad my mental state was. I never told anyone. I was diagnosed with depression and put on meds, but if anyone really knew how bad it was, I likely truly would have been put in a mental health hospital. This is where the most insane part was, since being on my meds, I'm a lot more stable. But I miss being the way I was. Even though they were supposed to, my meds didn't help my depression. It really just made me more stable. Now without AIDEN or cutting myself or the enjoyment of listening to emo music as I sadistically laugh and cry at the same time, I just feel empty. Though I was completely fucked up, it was still fun a times to laugh at how much I hate myself and my life. Now I can't do those things anymore. It's like being insane was a big part of me and my depression. The insanity itself was taken away, but the depression was still left. Now there's just a big, empty, dark hole.",0

9731,"Freshman in high school or college? If HS, you can get a work permit at 15 I think. You're supposed to have one as long as you're working and under 18. As for finding one at that age most people I know went into food or retail. Coffee shops, fast food, some with cars did pizza delivery. Theaters usually higher younger people. They're simple jobs that don't require a lot of training and younger employees help keep younger crowds coming in. There should be someone at your school like a counselor with info on work permits.  Edit: its also great that you want to work. Having the money can give you more breathing room with bills and you can start building some retirement money. Plus having the experience will help get better jobs. Just remember you don't have to save everything. If all you do is work and your money goes right back out to food/bills/rent/etc, work will become a burden. Put aside a little bit each paycheck as a whatever fund. It wont be much at first but after a few months you'll have a good bit of change set aside. Wanna go for a weekend getaway? Do it. Looking for a new TV. Buy it. I usually set aside $100 month and typically buy something I'd wanted after a few months but couldn't normally justify. Worked out well.

I know the feeling, though can't be sure that's what you're worried about. Maybe it's about meeting people? People can be stupid, demanding and stuff. Sometimes, even friends can feel like a burden to some people. Doesn't mean they hate their friends, it just drains them to constantly have to cater to their friends to keep them.

9742,"I tend to go back to sleep over and over, and I eat at dinner time. spend the nights playing video games and then I oversleep. I need a balance of alone time and time with friends to start feeling like myself again, and if I get that balance wrong I can meltdown. I tend to downplay my problems to the people around me and upplay them to strangers. For example, inflate things for the sake of a conversation with some crisis volunteer or something, just to get some free sympathy and support that I have to feel weird about later because I see that person again. But, if a friend asks me how doing, my first reaction is to reply I have good friends so they call me out on this.  I self sabotage by missing appointments or shutting out natural light. If cold, thirsty, hungry or uncomfortable, I ignore it and let myself suffer. I know getting better when I start doing certain things for myself. If I make myself some tea or get more blankets or sit somewhere other than my bed, I tell myself because I care about myself and want to feel better. I have physical pain associated with depression, usually I feel an ache in my arms and legs. When I have the energy I stretch to alleviate it. This also helps me feel better.  I have to be conscious of whether I have the energy to do something, because if I force myself I could get overwhelmed and just sink further down. had to learn to say no to people when what they ask of me is more than I can provide without suffering later. But, for the most part, learned my depression will leave when good and ready. been going downhill for two months and had a meltdown a few nights ago so been thinking a lot about what I really need to get through these times. These depressed phases tend to last 4-6 months for me so still got a long way to go. This my first rodeo, though, prepared. learned that there are plenty of little things I can do that feel like self care. Self care is not always an elaborate bath with essential oils and red wine. To me self care is getting up to make a cup of tea, spending a couple minutes stretching, or ordering food when hungry instead of waiting until everything is closed and starving. It have to make you feel better all at once, but all those little things add up, and it means more when you put conscious value on it. will stretch so my body hurt so much, and I do this because I care about feeling I say to myself.

9787,"That has to be tough. It's different strokes for different folks of course but I might have a suggestion. I find my depression tends to be racing negative thoughts. My understanding is that there are two default brain modes, one is random thought, day dreaming for example, and the other is processing. So you need to switch from day dreaming to processing, and that is hard for everyone. Start with meditation. Close your eyes for 5min and focus on your breathing. If your thoughts drift from breathing, then shut it down n snap back to breathing. Don't get emotional, just stay calm and focus on breathing. When finished, move everything that is a distraction away from you. No phone, no internet if possible, just clear that shit away and start studying as if it is your breathing. This focus is just like a muscle and the more you flex the stronger it will become. Don't expect to focus for hours on end, but try to catch yourself when you drift and get back to that focus. Also make studying fun, or less boring. Take notes, highlight pages, repeat the things you read. Most importantly, try telling a story with what you are learning. It's a strong method for memorization. People with ordinary memories use stories and codes to memorize full decks of cards in minutes. Good luck!",0

There is always a reason, why some things happen. The reason is, to teach you a lesson. For example: if you have no friends (like me), see it as negative. Try to find the lesson behind this experience. In this case, life wants to tell you, that loneliness is not what you, in your deepest self, want. You need persons such as friends around you. Take a desicion now, that you want to be lonely anymore, and life will listen to you and bring you friends again, and if it work, try to know, why it (i know the answer, but a bit complicated (msg me if you want to know)) and what the lesson in this experience is.

Stick with what makes logical sense (you don't need to be successful in the graduating and having a high-paying job sense), not what people will validate, because they won't collectively validate everything that makes sense (namely, the idea in parentheses above: the same idea that you don't need to be successful; most people aren't going to validate that, so fuck them). If it makes logical sense that you don't need to be successful in their bullshit sense, go with that, regardless of whether people will back it up. Logic over worthless people's worthless validation.",2
9825,"I have very bad social anxiety. It's the reason why I'm depressed actually. Every single day, even a simple interaction with someone can make me feel sad. I worry about stupid shit like did I say bye to a friend the right way. Stuff like that and just being a severely shy person is making me feel I won't be able to get anywhere in life. I'm nearly 16, so it might not seem like something I need to worry about. But it seems everyone else around me has everything sorted out. All my friends have partners, a job and are pretty confident in themselves. But with me having none of those things, I feel like the only place my life is going is living with my parents until I spiral into a deeper depression and probably take my life.",2
9826,"Sometimes, when something happens in the moment, we see it as this huge thing because it is the center of our focus. It is only once those moments pass that we can look back and connect the dots to see that it really wasn't such a big deal. So my advice is this: As you look forward, remember that in the past the dots have always connected correctly, and have faith that those dots will connect the way they need to again. People often ask me why I don't worry about these seemingly huge problems in my life. Well, it's not that I don't worry, because I do. That's just being human, but I constantly remind myself that things usually just work out, and I just need to run the course that I see in front of me. So follow the course, stay on track, and when little problems feel like mountains in front of you, have faith that the dots will connect, and you will come out the other side as a stronger person. Good luck, my friend.",2

Spinach is a good choice because it's pretty nutrient dense as opposed to lettuce, and it's easy to add to stuff. You can even grab a can on minestrone (or any other type) soup, heat it up and dump a bunch of spinach into it to boost the vegetable content. My go to recently has been a spinach salad with goat cheese and balsamic vinaigrette dressing. Maybe some day I'll get fancy and add onions or peppers or whatever to make it a real salad, but at this point, it's better than the grilled cheese by itself or whatever else I'm eating.

9851,"I would say plan around your depression. You gotta give yourself more time to do stuff because there will be days where you just do work. If on average you give yourself 2 weeks to do a paper, give yourself 3 weeks and push yourself to work when you have good days.  Know that going to be tiring to try to work as soon as your depression temporarily lifts and just take things in small increments. Write a paragraph a day for 3 weeks and or write two paragraphs when you miss a day due to depression and voila! Same results, different pace, depression included and worked around. Practice self care and indulge in the fee things that make you feel okay. stay in your dorm/apartment constantly. Seriously, even if you go to the library for a few hours a day, it helps with isolation.  If you like to write, start roleplays with people on geeking or rolemance and reply when you need a break from academic writing. Otherwise indulge in low energy hobbies. And try to eat 2 meals a day even when you feel like it. It makes a difference.  Overall, the transition is going to be rough and even more rough for you because of depression so try not to get stuck in a loop of bad habits. Break your routine if not making you feel good and professors are more understanding than not about late assignments and group projects. Be candid with them. Tell them you have the disability accommodations et but working on them.  Good luck!!!",0

9858,"What types of jobs are you applying for?  I ask because every single job (since graduating college) I've ever had has been a job where the company required a degree, but the job itself didn't necessary need the skills provided by a degree. They used the degree as a way to weed people out. I have a BA as well, and student debt, but I don't feel like it wasn't worth anything. Even though I took a pay cut with my new job (for better benefits), my income is still more than the average income for a family where I live. I say this because, at this point, you can't change that you got a BA. You just gotta accept it and don't dwell on the I should have dones because if you do, you'll just fuck yourself over and the negativity will eat you alive. Now, you just gotta make a plan - what can you do with your degree? What are some skills you learned from your degree and previous jobs that can transfer over to something else? Is there anything at all you can cut from your budget? Get a roomie? Etc. Plans suck and when you're already depressed, the are the last things you want to be worried about, but it's hard to change things you don't like without one.

I've had hardcore depression for many years, but I have definitely moved the bar significantly (without meds and without getting what i want in life or something, like a great relationship) which I can confirm especially in the moments when my external circumstances are going terribly, but i dont fall into 6 months of suicidal morbidity. I see depression (speaking only for myself here) as a product of thoughts and meanings. The same thing can happen to two people, and a depressed person will give it an incredibly dark meaning, whereas a non depressed person might give it a neutral or positive one. To me, growth out of depression is when you are finally grasping the arbitrary nature of meaning, and the impersonal nature of thought, and can start to make conscious rather than automatic decisions about what kind of meanings and thoughts you feed and go with (even arbitrarily). So, I arbitrarily decide to look at failing as good, because it gives me good reference experiences, rather than as evidence that i am worthless. Things like that. I still struggle a lot, but there is overwhelming evidence that you can slowly climb out of the hole with very hard inner work, and that the things that would have previously sent you down the spiral become more like non issues.

The first thing you should do is to find out the top three things, basically your skills that you are good at and which can help you in some way for getting online jobs. 2. Make a list of such jobs that you can opt for as per your top three skill-sets. 3. The next thing is to look for free or paid online resources to learn about that job and start applying.  I would suggest starting with some easy job that you can find without any trouble. For instance, you can do data entry in the beginning.

9973,"I saw your post several hours ago and I've been thinking all afternoon about what you asked. I'm not sure if I can fully explain the shift I made from being depressed and suicidal to the generally happy person I am now. There was a whole series of decisions and lessons and realizations I've made over a period of several years which probably merits its own post (or series of them). I joined this subreddit a short time ago and have been sort of lurking, trying to understand this community and seeing if I have anything to contribute, and your post makes me realize that maybe just telling my story will help others make their own way on their journey.  To answer your specific question, the one thing I have come to understand is that there really isn't going to be a time when you are entirely done with it. There will always be a chance, however small, that you can fall back into it. However the longer you go without falling back in, the easier it gets. I tend to think of it in terms of black holes and orbital bodies. I'm going to have to create a post on that.  The truths I've found is that recovery and freedom from depression is about breaking habitual negative lines of thought by replacing it with more positive ones. It's about learning how to recognize when you are falling back into the pit of depression, and being able to pull yourself back out. It's about accepting and finding value in yourself, and finding many many reasons to continue to be alive, to contribute and interact with the rest of the world. Coming from the other side, I understand so many things that I used to see as negative really don't have any sort of positive or negative connotation. That was all in my head. Often those negative connotations were put there by others, sometimes inadvertently, sometimes deliberately. I had to learn how to strip those ideas off and choose a new set of ideas to assign. I learned how to identify what kind of ideas were worth keeping and using, and which ones were not and discard them.  I know this doesn't really explain much how I see things now, and how I no longer feel depressed all the time, but I promise to share my story in the hopes of helping you understand how I got where I am, and maybe help you make a similar journey.",2
9974,I know how you feel. Iv watched a short film about a guy with depression that can't kill himself. So he hires somebody to do it. It's a actually a really good short film. Look it up on YouTube . It's called Mr.Happy by Vice.,2

I understand why it upsets you, people like us, most people with depression, hang on to the little negative things throughout their day that most people brush off, and they eat away at us. But I want you to know, that it's okay. If it really made you uncomfortable, confront him / her about it. Or talk to HR if you want. Or your boss, or whomever.

10009,"It's a terrible feeling when you try to hold on to even the most minuscule things that bring you any slight amount of joy, and one by one those things get taken from you. What I try to do is work back on a route to the thing that would lead to getting the one thing that could be right. i.e. something that costs money makes you happy, but you don't make enough money; need a way to make more money; dedicate all free time to applying for better work. Or, feel lonely and haven't got anybody; need to find somebody to stop feeling like that; need to know best places to find somebody; research ways to meet people and put self into that situation. Or feel worthless; being of use to someone or something would make me feel less worthless; dedicate myself to making myself of use to someone who needs somebody; use free time aiding charity or institution where people need you, and you can feel needed. Honestly, I know it's not that easy a fix, and there will be more bumps to overcome. One of my larger problems is isolation and loneliness, and even having looked at places to go, I still haven't found the courage to put myself into a situation to meet people. But generating a simple starting point where you can do something easily achievable, even just through reading online about how to get started, can make you feel proactive and start to get you into a more productive feeling that maybe it won't be like that forever, and that there is a physical, tangible, mortal way to deal with the situation. So, I would recommend pick a small goal that CAN lead to some form of happiness and work towards that, rather than try to envision this great milestone of achieving happiness in one big leap. Helps you take it day by day a little easier, and I hope that would make each new day, if not better, at least consistent for you. Feel better soon, bud.",2

Maybe then the Falcons would have taken the 2nd half of that game against the Patriots more seriously.

10124,I just read an article about someone jumping a fence and into someone's yard before stabbing several of the homeowners security guards. Just reminds me of how decrepit society has become. It's as if we've lost all touch with morality and compassion towards one another and such crimes are a grim reminder of the reality.,0
10125,This guy that I just read about seriously cannot be trusted. He was going around acting like an apartment belonged to him when it did not in actuality. I wonder will he be punished sufficiently. I doubt it. He will probable just strike a deal and that will be the end of it. He needs to be publicly shamed.,2

10129,I feel so bad for that innocent customer. This is something that is unfortunate and a random freak incident. All over a declined card this man got so upset that he had to take it out on other people. It is shocking to me that some people can have so much anger in them to do something like that. That person that was shot was just going there on a normal day to get coffee and now his loved ones can't see him no more all because someone got worked up over a declined card. I guess we need to have security every where nowadays it seems. No place is safe to go. You can't even go to the coffee shop without worrying someone is going to pull out a gun at you.,0
10130,"I'm the last one to want to victim blame anyone. I think as a celebrity you have to be a bit more conscious of your actions. Do I think Kim by posting the pics made someone want to rob her? No, but I think it's probably best to be more modest about what you post. I mean, just for safeties sake. I agree, I'd be scared to post about Tristan's ring too especially since it wasn't so long ago that Kim was robbed. Yes, I'm sure everything is insured, but it's still a scary experience and I'd do everything I could to avoid it.",0
10131,"Gosh, another article about the Middle East and terrorists. This was is pretty much like the one I ready earlier. Things never get better. The terrorists won't even allow people to leave the city they're holding, to try and reach the Iraqi army nearby who could help them. Maybe the UN needs to step in and do something.",0
10132,This article held some very valid views that I have been trying to explain for years. The hypocrisy that America generates is overwhelming and others can see this too.

10134,"After reading this article, I had to write you and share it with you. You see, we aren't just crazy parents telling our children to slow down every chance we get. These young men were out doing something they absolutely loved and doing it with their closest friends, and now they don't have the opportunity to grow old and continue to enjoy many more things to come. They were so young and had their whole lives ahead of them. I can't imagine how their families are feeling right now. Hug your little ones a little tighter tonight.",2
10135,There are immigrants in this country that are having a hard time assimilation in to the American Culture. The article blames Trump I believe there are most things at work here than just him.

10139,Why am I so ignorant when it comes to politics. I just reread an article 3 times over to try and figure out what it was talking about with Trump and jobs and discrimination and racism by the end of it all three times I felt like I had read gibberish. Is that how politics are for you or do you actually understand it. All I understand is that I don't agree with Trump I don't agree with his Antics I don't agree with his policies. I'm not sure if he's selfish or just a moron right now. How do you feel?,0

10141,"Hey hun! I was just reading this article about a family of 3 young black boys who went through foster care and ended up in prison later on in life, and it made me want to share it with you.  It breaks my heart knowing this probably happens all the time in our country! That there are kids who, through no fault of their own, are set on a path that ultimately leads to their downfall and punishment later in life! There need to be changes made to the foster system so that there are more homes available and counselling for these kids so that they can learn at an early age to deal with the things they are going through instead of internalizing it all and becoming angry and bitter. What do you think? Maybe we could write some letters to get people thinking about this situation!",2
10142,How to deal with that burning question of what is murder before birth and what isn't? Is it murder because it was against your will?

So just pile up the bodies of the woman and stack up the children murdered. Herd the maimed into a corner and block it all all of your concious. Too much insanity and too much gore to think about so the healthy thing for you do is just ignore these stories since there will a new one or two or ten tommorrow and forever",2
10147,I think its sick having these kids working. These kids should be playing and having an education. Why are they doing this? This just shows you how much people care about money. Its disgusting. Human beings are disgusting. I feel so ashamed. God will punish all of these people. We are just being controlled. Someone needs to put this to an end. I really hope these children get the life they deserve. This is why there is a lot of people suffering from depression because of these terrible things going on.,2

People buy products in hopes that the product will make them feel a certain way: either happy, excited or beautiful.

10150,Passing this article along to you! Remember how we were just discussing this? I guess there is enough doubt now in the death of the Polish former president that died in that plane crash that they now are exhuming the body.

I have to say the findings rang true to me and brought back a lot of memories.

It's very dry, and I don't understand half the words, but while I was reading it, I was feeling sort of glad that apparently plant and animal species are adapting to the warming climate. It seemed like the planet is warming slowly enough for a lot of ecosystems to adapt. And then I read the last bit, about humans and agriculture, and got cold all over again. Will we adapt, too? I gotta say, at this point, I'm hoping that volcano in Hawaii spews a gazillion tons of ash (after everyone's been evacuated, of course) into the atmosphere to block the sun and cool things down.

The confederate flag seems to somehow have different meanings to different people, which I never really understood.  To get upset because the flag was being hung in college campuses, makes sense to me.  I would get upset as well.  For students to be afraid for their welfare and or they education at their college because of President elect Trump, also makes sense to me.  The whole campaign seems to be one big controversy.",0

I seen nothing in the article that explained the protestor was violent or a danger to the ones around him. Just shot for protesting. This is an outrage!",0

In a scolding tone, Gingrich tried to tell Kelly which words she could or could not use. Gingrich once had a fascination of his own with Bill Clinton’s sex life, as he was a driving force behind the movement to impeach Clinton following a consensual sexual relationship he had with a young former intern. Clinton became the second president in American history to be impeached by the House, but he was acquitted by the Senate. Voters, meanwhile, punished the Republicans for what they saw as an overreach: The GOP lost five House seats in the 1998 midterm elections, which led to Gingrich’s resignation as speaker.",2

India is like hell in Earth. I would lock up these government people in solitary confinement for life and let the fly ash befall on their heads so they can find out what getting tuberculosis and liver decease is like for these poor people!

While they may not have the same protections that the accused have in the United States, they should still give her a new trial, something quiet, out of the public eye, maybe even outside of the country, where she can get a fair trial based on the facts.

You know that I was in the military myself and it makes it that much harder on me.  I can't begin to imagine how the families of these soldiers must feel.  From what I read, apparently this was an accident and the soldiers were shot when they failed to stop at the checkpoint going into the base.  The base was already on alert due to a previous car bomb attack.  I'm guessing that they felt they couldn't take any chances on it being another car bomber and went ahead and shot at the vehicle.  It's so sad.  It's bad enough that these brave men have to face dangers from the enemy, but when they get taken down by friendly fire?",2
10174,That is really sad to hear. It's awful that cars can be so unsafe and sometimes people forget how easy it is to get into an accident if everyone isn't careful and observant.

10177,Our country is really at a place right now where its going the wrong direction of what an ideal society should be and how a lot people are worried about the future as well.

10202,This story left me feeling pretty confused. It was so short and didn't provide a lot of answers at all. I was left wondering why France wanted to dismantle the camp and why the refugees were so angry and against the move. What was really going on here? Were there some other issues that had nothing to do with humanitarian considerations? It seems like there's usually more to the story with refugee stories.,0
10203,Thank goodness for PresdientTrump  hopefully this means an end to DACA and hopefully immigration reform in the near future!  These people have broken the law and are here illegally yet they expect to be treated just like US citizens.  DACA is a slap in the face to those immigrants who followed the law and went through the process to become legal citizens.  Liberals are not adjusting very well to the defeat of Hillary - they are still crying.,0
10204,I think this world is full of hate and i don't understand it. Why do they hate us? Why are they killing innocent people?And Donald trump isn't going to make anything better. He shows people hate and we might have even more terrosist coming to America. America should show people how to love. America acts like the victim but we have fault as well. There is no country that is right or wrong we are all human and we are all imperfect. The only king we should listen to is God. A lot of these presidents and kings of our countries think there god. We should humble ourselves and just love. Put ourselves in other peoples shoes.,2

The disaster struck when a dam ruptured and polluted the most important river in Brazil where people were getting their foods and surviving from what the river had to offer. Now it it polluted with mining waste because of the rupture of the dam. I feel really bad that they are in a position where they cant even eat the fish in the river because the fish showed some kind of mutation because of the pollution. It really sucks that a company just pays a minimal amount after causing a huge disaster like this totally unfair",2

I just read about a mother from Fresno Texas who not only kicked her elementary son out of the house for voting in a mock school election for Donald Trump she also videotaped it. Well, of course, the video went viral. The Fort Bend County Texas sheriff's department went to check out the situation and the child seemed to be in good health. The mother made the child stand on the street corner with a sign telling why he was kicked out of the house. The mother claims now that it was only a joke. I hope the child is not permanently scarred from this incident.",2

The study was performed by the University of Copenhagen and has confirmed a link between hormonal contraceptives and depression. The study was extensive and performed over a decade. The incident of depression was magnified over 28% when taking the combination pill, and even went as high as 78% in the teenage population! Alternatives to the pill which are longer-acting such as the ring and implant were even higher scoring in depression. One outstanding take-away for me in this article is the fact that women are only fertile about six days per month as opposed to men who are basically fertile every day, and yet the birth control burden falls on women. Hopefully men will share that soon.",0

It would be great to get a full accounting of everything he actually owns so that he can repay everyone he has ever ripped off over his lifetime of scamming people.

There were four adults and two girls. The ride flipped over and trapped the adults. The little girls somehow escaped, but their parents were among the four dead. Apparently, the park workers didn't even notice it right away. One of the girls was by the ride exit by herself. The girls may need a lot of counseling for the rest of the lives. It was pretty bad.

I mean afterall, she's just trying to do what's best for herself by escaping a land that is overrun with various terrorist groups and warring clans.

I believe I saw something not that long ago that actually painted the tusks and got s of elephants and rhinos that permantely stained them so the poachers work not beable ti use the ivory.

10348,"Cohen moved to New York in 1966 at age 31 to break into the music business. Before long, critics were comparing him with Bob Dylan for the lyrical force of his songwriting. Although he influenced many musicians and won many honors, including induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and the Order of Canada, Cohen rarely made the pop music charts with his sometimes moody folk-rock. His most ardent admirers compared his works to spiritual prophecy. He sang about religion, with references to Jesus Christ and Jewish traditions, as well as love and sex, political upheaval, regret and what he once called the search for “a kind of balance in the chaos of existence.",2

Everything shuts down around you,” the composer told Entertainment Tonight Canada later adding that Bublé will not sing again until his child is well.I’m certain of it he saidMany fans have reached out to the singer through social media, and Foster said that a few have contacted him wishing to extend their well-wishes and resources to Bublé.

Either way, it was man-made problems that did this little guy in. I wish they would blame it thoroughly on climate change, so people would maybe be spurred to do something. Instead, right now they'll say ""Oh, it wasn't *really* climate change,"" and when a more clear-cut extinction happens, they'll point back to this and say ""Well, it's been going on for a long time now, nothing we can do.""

10363,So there were the guys who were basically mad the government made local land into a wildlife refuge. They went as far as getting a militia together. They had guns and were watching. They had a whole group of them involved. The problem is they shot and killed someone. Can you say it went to far? I do. I think the whole thing was a bit much. I mean they just took over the federal land. You can't just do that no matter what you stand for.,0

Roberts wrote that four of the other justices had voted in favor of staying the execution. While it takes five justices to overturn a lower court ruling, it takes only four to accept a case. “To afford them the opportunity to more fully consider the suitability of this case for review, including these circumstances, I vote to grant the stay as a courtesy,” he wrote.

I think the solution is to hold off with allowing much Muslim immigration until Muslims start polling better on ideas involving apostates, etc.  As evidenced by polls (even in European countries), the ideas Muslims accept put them at odds with basic educational values.  I think seeking a professional to talk and try to fix mental issues can be a good thing.  The right therapy can likely help certain people.    What concerns me is living situations that are unhealthy for economic reasons, and psychological problems concerning motivation.

I don't like the cutting down of rain forests and believe that needs to end, but I think there are other answers.  Getting rid of a great food supply is not one of them.  Eating meat keeps us healthy and strong and may be the reason our brains grew to the size they did.  Many politicians would want our brains to start getting smaller and more compliant.

To me it seems like people did not want to deal with her for some reason or they were on a small budget and could not afford to treat her so they turned her away.

They deserve to be free. On top of this rare species should always be protected.,2

The article says that Trump and the congress are going to undo what Obama started. The article says that they are also trying to undo Obama care and that’s part of it.  I know Obamacare made me poorer by about $600 a month and I’m not rich!  It goes on about SS and how evil tax cuts are.  I don’t know what to think about this since the news these days are often fiction.  It seems to contradict itself by saying unemployment rates have dropped.

The truth of the matter is, the G.W. Bush  administration had no idea what they were doing when they decided to invade Iraq under the pretense of ridding Saddam Hussein of weapons of mass destruction: Iraq had none, and we destroyed the Iraqi way of life over this lie. Iraqis may have suffered under Saddam Hussein, but at the very least, the region was stable and extremists were rare.

The article I read was about air quality and I wondered if it's hard to teach Indian citizens the affects of what they are doing. Maybe teaching them in school would help.

These types of scenarios are unacceptable.  I tend to believe that a system that will let the guilty go free is preferable to one that will punish even one innocent man.

This is so heartbreaking to me because these are innocent animals, endangered ones at that, that are just living in their natural environment and have done nothing wrong. How can the government in Indonesia think that this idea is even a possibility, never mind the fact it could not possibly be a positive thing because of the negative impact it has on this species!!",2

The U.S. let's them in to ship them back out and that is a bit ridiculous. It's not a situation where those from Mexico just sneak over and hide from society. These people need help but it doesn't shock me that the U.S. wiould do this in a time of need. Sympathy felt but helpless to do anything about it.",2

The reasoning seems to be that male models have a longer career, whereas women are considered going downward after thirty. The gap in pay between them is quite high.

The old saying that you ""need money to make money"" is true in the sense that if you show up on our shores with nothing at all, it's going to be awfully hard to make anything of yourself.  That being said, the American dream has always been one of pulling yourself up by the bootstraps and being a self-made-man.

She trailed by 8 points in a poll released on Thursday, after polls earlier this month showed a dead heat.

That was so sad.  It triggered a tsunami and 500 people were killed.  Not to mention the fact that there were 220,000 homes lost.  One piece of good news at least, since the 8.8 earthquake, they have put in a warning system for earthquakes and tsunamis.  Thank God for that.

She shouldn't be taking selfies in the first place while driving, not only to mention that she was topless just so her boyfriend could get a look at ""the goods."" While you're driving, you should be paying attention and not playing on your cell phone because you're putting the lives of others at risk.",0
10565,"The US has done some super shady things. How we treated these people is horrible, and I'm not sure whether I'm more upset or just feel bad for the Americans who went along with it. It sort of reminds me of the SS officers during WWII- like at some point it seems like they all realized what they were doing wasn't kosher and definitely crossing ethical boundaries. Yet they all continued because .... why? I know the whole thing about the military is going along and just obeying orders but what was going on there was seriously seriously messed up.",0
10566,"I just read the article on the oil spill.  Even though I do agree with oil digging, when things go wrong, it does have severe consequences.  I feel mostly bad for the birds and sea life, which will obviously be affected.  You would think with all the money these oil companies profit from, they would take more safety precautions, in trying to avoid accidents from happening.  I know the industry creates a lot of jobs and most often, nothing goes wrong.  But when it does, it can be catastrophic for the wildlife in the area and those that live in the area.  Or even those areas that rely on tourism, if people can’t go into the oceans or there is oil spilling onto their beaches.  Not sure what the answer is, or if there even is an answer to it.  It just makes me sad to see those beautiful birds",2

I learned a few facts about the singer of a song I have heard fairly often over the years, so it is interesting to have new information, which always feels rewarding in a way. I guess I should feel sad but I just don't think it's possible for me to feel sadness every time I read about someone being dead. It makes me feel a bit tired I suppose.",0

The way I see it, it was obvious that the guy was decompensating in some way, but he didn't display anything that indicated he was violent - that had to all be in her head. Yes, when the cops order you to do something, it's probably better to comply, especially if they have draw weapons including tasers. No one disputes that his hands were up, and the other officer assessed the situation to require a taser, not a gun, and apparently, this scenario goes against training, so the problem was in the officer, not the victim. People wonder why the police aren't trusted, and this is it. They're human too, and they make mistakes, but their mistakes kill people unjustly. I feel bad for the family of the victim and I hope they see justice done.",2

I don't understand how people can treat these beautiful animals so poorly. It really make me sad.",2
10571,This article was really inspiring. The woman in it goes through so much but she still tries to persevere. I think it is admirable to not give up in the face of such obstacles.

10572,No need to read this article for my fellow animal lovers.  Its just sad and kinda infuriating.  People are just worthless shits.  There really isnt much else to say about this.

She has been in and out of hospitals for the past three months in an attempt to regain her vision. Nothing has worked so far, but she remains hopeful.

They found mass graves of people killed by ISIS and although there is some confusion about the details, there are dozens or maybe over 100 bodies. There is also evidence of torture.

This is not a choice most people want to make, let alone be forced to flee their homes. Churches, homes, and streets were not safe. Many people have considered fleeing over returning. However, the human spirit is strong. We all face adversity. Some are brave enough to face the terror and harassment they experienced to rebuild their lives.",2

When people do not get along, not because of a shortage of food or water, but rather because a belief system is not universal, that is a human tragedy.   Saudi Arabia and Iran are prime examples of animalistic behavior at this point in time.    We here in America pretty much  killed off the American Indians because we wanted the land.  Nothing different is happening in the Middle East.  We always hear that might makes right but that's not truly the case.  Might makes blight and generations suffer till most of it is forgotten.  The moral is too  learn from our mistakes and the bad aspects of what history tries to teach us .",2

While some strive to save this or that, there are a million other things destroying it further. We need to end the destruction of our global ecosystem, and not pick and choose species to save. Other wise there will be nothing left, and those efforts would have been in vein.",0

In the cell they had to spend nearly 24 hours a day together in a concrete room smaller than a parking space, can you imagine?   I learned that they have a form of punishment there and it is called ""four-pointing"".  They cuff each limb to the corner of a concrete slab or bed frame.  That just sounds like torture to me.  The guy that the story is about is serving a 35-year sentence for drug trafficking and assaulting a corrections officer.  This prison is known as the toughest prison and I can see why.  You really should read this article, it is very eye opening.",2

I doubt after moving to multiple houses that you would not have noticed something was off. I mean you never went into these closets? The biggest issue here though is that this woman thought she would rid herself of a problem because of social services checking in on her. It is disgusting. I am surprised the other kids survived. They all must have lived in fear of this lady. Makes me so mad people kill kids.,2

The pettiness inside me kind of smirks at the growing population of them. There is nothing to blame for the existing and gaining population of goldfish, except for ourselves. I mean their very existence is because people wanted more appealing fish for their gardens and maybe aquariums too.

But at the same time, it is people's action indirectly that caused the extinction, through contributing to climate change.  There is so much that can go out of balance in nature when people are involved.  When one species dies off, then everything in that ecosystem changes.  I guess the article was kind of interesting.  But what is the solution the problem they are talking about?  How should people intervene to save those animals?",0

The fact is that there really is a problem of police feeling justified in shooting people whenever they feel threatened, but this doesn't just happen to blacks.

He wasn't involved in an crime at all, but the police burst into his house with guns blazing and he died. And the cop won't be prosecuted.

I try to put myself in their position, and wonder what would be my hearts desire as to a viable solution. If it would be more beneficial to relocate to another area, where I can then begin to rebuild my life, and replace that which was destroyed. However there is an underlying disadvantage to Louisiana, as a whole, if in the case so many would want to leave and relocate. The State is in a very difficult and decisive moment, given what they are faced with. Especially in the areas of unemployment, on average when someone is having problems finding gainful employment, they will move to another location for work reasons alone, and nothing to do with a natural disaster as Louisiana is faced with.",2

He ended up having to have surgery to remove the chopstick out of hiis penis.

Apparently there is a statistical study that says 100,000 people have been killed by this. The researchers tried to count ""early deaths"" and got that figure. I suspect the root problem is corruption. Some of the business owners in Indonesia and Malaysia are extremely rich and can act with impunity, even though their actions cause great harm to the environment and to humans near and far. Maybe they should be charged with crimes for the deaths. On the other hand I dislike the idea of people being convicted of crimes via statistical analysis. It is too easy to manipulate.",2

After that, they are largely on their own.

Well, come to find out Wells Fargo just discovered 80,000 phony accounts that must have been opened to fulfill branch quotas. Aren't these the institutions we'e supposed to trust with our money! I understand they don't think it's a big deal because out of millions it was only 80,000, but I find it extremely concerning that the higher ups down know what's really happening in day to day operations.

10710,"This article was quite interesting to me. It talked about the invention of a new male contraceptive. It talks about the potential side effects that steer men away from using the contraceptive. The writer of the article mocks men for avoiding these contraceptives when female contraceptives have way more side effects to them. I personally disagree with the writer - if male contraceptives were invented before female contraceptives, I believe that males would have no problem using them despite the side effects. What are your thoughts?",2

Because this guy was an idiot it gets written up to feed the idiotic interests of the sheep.,0

Really...just rent a hotel room when you can go. Buying into a house with other people sounds like a total hassle and a problem waiting to happen. But I can't stand how grimy the companies are and how they jerk people around. It just shows that the whole timeshare concept is about digging into people's pockets.

I agree with Obama on ISIS being a jv team. I can't help but feel terrible for those who have to witness the bodies all over Mosul. What a horrible sight that must be. Can people heal once they see that? Do those people have any hope or any way to continue after they witness such atrocities? What about the children? I feel so bad for them. It's so crazy.

There was a grace period, but the country was really unprepared for it still. The banks didn't have enough smaller bills to trade to people. The poor weren't able to go to work because they had to stand in line at ATMs. Someone made a really good point that the real money from corruption is stored in Swiss banks. I agree!",0
10782,I think they should both be charged with murder. It's obvious at least one of them did it but I'm assuming both. It's crazy what this world has come to people just killing people all the time and usually for no reason. It's crazy and people need to be punished harsher. If you kill someone on person for no reason you should automatically get the death sentence.,2
10783,"It's almost funny because I was looking at something really similar to this on Steve Wilkos, that a baby got hurt after pushing through a window screen and Steve was yelling at her and saying how she was so negligent and a bad mom but I honestly think that it's not the parents fault. Sometimes accidents just really so happen and kids are curious and they climb and then accidents happen. It's really upsetting for all of those involved and I really feel for the mom in this case because she just lost her kid and she probably blames herself enough as it is. She doesn't need society talking badly about her from behind closed doors. Accidents are just accidents and it can happen to anyone, although I think that everyone can agree that it's a really sad situation overall.",2

10787,Remember when I told you I had ringing in my ear sometimes? This article seems to parallel what I was talking about. Can you look into this further? I really trust your viewpoint on this.

Thanks again man!,2

I guess it’s an unsolicited public service message of sorts.  She had some sort of tumor that made it necessary.  She had the baby and that’s the god news.  Surprisingly, she got about 1200 “likes” in total.  I found myself wanting to out of sympathy.  Who needs birth control with this kind of publicity?  She says she loves her scar.

I thought it would do the opposite because it allows women to have a full sex like without worrying about pregnancy, so they and their partners can feel more relaxed and open to exploring their sexuality. But now that i read the article I can see the link between hormone fluctuations and mood disorders since the two effect each other.",0

She cashed in and got a lot of fame. I can't say I really feel that sorry for her. If it was me I would have just said, ""no"" and moved on.

And through incompetent measures in our government and military, we let go of Mosul and are again trying to figure out a way to take it back.  It makes me sad that there are people being oppressed in the world but it is also clear to me that at what cost do we fight the oppressors and pick a whose side to be on.  Maybe we should worry about ourselves stateside and stay out of the mess in the middle east.",0
10801,I just read the article and i want to say i think its terrible anyone would actually blame the doctors for someone committing suicide. Of course its incredibly sad and i feel for anyone that has to go through what people like that do go through but how can these doctors be blamed. That means that anyone can be blamed for missing the signs and its too hard to tell when someone will actually commit to killing themselves even when they are making empty threats.,2

10806,What I learned from this story is that this world is really fucked up. Imagine forceful sex at an age when your organs are not developed and when you have complete faith in everyone around you results in both physical and mental trauma. You think that any person who is around you and is trying to act sweet with you will end up being a molester. That is why a victim behaves like that. It's vile man.,0

His identity was stolen and then later he was mistakenly identified as the wrong person. Society needs to do a better job of providing enough resources for the ""accused"" to ensure that the perpetrator doesn't get a free ride while the accused seems to lose everything.    We do live in a society where supposedly you are innocent till proven guilty, right?  How can one lose a drivers license and a job without 100% proof on the table?

How disturbed must one be to see this sort of thing as the only way out, the right thing to do?  The pain and loss this family is feeling is probably only compounded due to the conflicting feelings of someone you love committing such an atrocious act on others you love, whose lives were just beginning.  Poor babies... I do hope they didn't suffer.  It shows that complaints of domestic issues should be taken seriously, by everyone.

I feel bad for this woman who felt a need to lie about her status of citizenship to stay in a country just to continue living a better life.

I think by the time our next Presidential election comes around we will be no longer be considered a destination country but anyone in the know. I don't see why this particular stat isn't a matter of culture though. I haven't met many women who expressed an interest in STEM and most of them didn't even want to talk to people who were into it when I was in college. Now women might be more interested but it still isn't going to be anything approaching equal because the culture doesn't work that way.,0

There were three U.S. military trainers killed in gunfire by security units at Jordan base, fatally shot by security forces Friday when their vehicle failed to stop at the gate of a military base. I have no idea why the driver did not stop at the gate, which is certainly protocol. They have had serious problems in Jordan recently due to hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees crossing their border. Jordan is and has been a significant U.S. ally in the war against ISIS and I can only hope that this incident is isolated and not part of a bigger problem.

Oh, and she has been in solitary for almost 30 years, that is a lifetime. Being captive  for such a long period caused major stress to her health as well as to her psychological well being.

To even think that the option of having dangerous amounts of mercury seep into the waters is beyond me.,2

This is a awful story that deserves to be heard by more people to make sure that the the kitten receives justice, and that the person who did this is not allowed to hurt any more animals. I think it is a great thing that this person is not allowing for someone to get away with this and making sure that others will stand with him and not allow this crime to go unpunished. I think it would be great if you could share this story and let others know so something like this can be stopped in the future.",2

These companies seem to want to be your best friend to get you to buy a timeshare, but once you do they do not care about you, your family, or what situation your life is in. They make it hard to get rid of because most of their customers are older people who don't always want to go through the hassle. These people need assistance because the timeshare companies make it too hard to get rid of. Although they may say that they have an easy process to relinquish, but after undercover investigations, that proved to be wrong.

Their investigations obviously are not thorough enough to always prevent attacks even whey they are forewarned about a specific person. The nightclub attack in Orlando seems like it could have been prevented if the FBI did their job. They had warnings from the killers family and basically a warning from the terrorist himself. With extremist like this guy, when they already had him once, I think more severe tactics are necessary to protect the country and its citizens. I feel like the FBI is just making excuses because they were incompetent and do not seem to take everything as serious as they need too. Our country deserves that!",0

And it talks about how he was working for the banks but also embraced Obama's position on banks, which seem like mutually exclusive things. He didn't do anything great in the Senate, but when he was governor, he saved that lady's daughter's college career. It's all very confusing, but overall, I'm glad he's staying gone.",0

Many estimates say that there are a lot of people in Russia who survived only on $4.50 a day.  With this little money they do not have the luxury of going out to eat.  Also when living on so little money it is dangerous because of Health Care problems.  If one has to  have surgery or even get expensive medication it can be a real setback to their life style.  I hope the Russian economy becomes better enough to support  it's elderly and everyone else in the country.,2

This man was literally bit by a snake, and still posted the selfie, and was more worried about how many ""likes"" he would get rather than his snake bite.

It made me feel empathic towards him. He stated that he did not like being around rich and important people. This made me feel like he is relatable. I did find it odd that they both wore vials of blood around their necks while they were together. It was a little gross. He even went into detail about how they cut their fingers together to get the blood and then compared it the lockets you can buy and put pictures of your grandmas in. I also did not realize that he is 20 years her junior. I found that to be a little old but I have seen it work. The article also briefly touched on her relationship with Brad.,2

It seems that human nature is causing these animals to be subjected to lives they shouldn't have to endure. If they were released into nature then maybe they would have a fighting chance but at the same time, most of them have been raised in the zoo perhaps so their ""social skills"" in nature may be quite the detriment as well. I just wish that some organization(s) could rescue them and take care of them the way they ought to be. No animal should really have to live in a zoo, to begin with, and now they are suffering from malnourishment and lack of care. It is tragic to read about this but it is the world in which we live.",2

I think that the Greenhouse Effect is highly over-rated. I find that the forces that oppose and are against it, has a strong point.

Well apparently it will not be ending any time soon.  It is a billion dollar industry and there is very little anyone can do about it.  There are organizations out there that is trying to prevent this and fight against childhood obesity.  The WHO organization is blaming video bloggers/vloggers who get paychecks from junk food companies.  They are claiming that they are more powerful than ads.  I'm not sure I believe that but it could be possible, you think?",0
11001,This article is so sad the hatred and anger we have towards one another in America needs to stop. Our children and grandchildren are going to grow up in a horrid place simply because we have people in our country who refuse to let go of the past.

Though details aren't completely clear, it sounds as if the son had some issues that weren't completely dealt with and it resulted in some sort of confrontation with his dad.

I am sure it is only a matter of time before that also comes out. The more and more I read about him, the more and more disturbed I am to have him as a president and wish I did not live in a country where that animal is calling the shots.

Having to leave their home and come to a foreign country where they don't know many people and having others not want you there. I understand that they had to leave their home country because of whatever issues the country was having but I wonder if these refugees could try a bit harder. It's hard to come here as an immigrant and I'm sure way more harder to come as a refugee but taking initiatives to push forward and somehow make it work would be the best thing possible.

Mr. Issa has been motivated by fear of political repercussions more than his constituents’ best interests.

Imagine going out to feed the squirrels like you usually do and in turn get attacked by these rabid critters! It's so shocking and I'm still shaking after reading this.

11075,"Oh my gosh!  Can you even imagine this?  Thinking of citizens being torn from their homes, tortured, frightened!  How could they just blatantly violate people in this way?  I suppose it is hopeful that we might learn from this, correct mistakes, but that doesn't mitigate the harm that was done!  It also doesn't bode well that protecting the victims now, after the fact, also seems to be in question.  The assumption that they were informed of the release of the data, I think, is reckless.  Verification that the already suffering victims won't be further victimized is as important as the far reaching implications of the data itself!  I wonder why there is no mention of the ramifications to the department either.  Just releasing the data is great, but what about investigations and punishments?",2

I feel like it's always on the women to be the ones to hold men accountable and to report it and everything but I'm so frustrated by the fact that men won't take a bigger stand. Men should hold each other accountable for sexual assault and encourage each other not to do it instead of making jokes about it all the time. I'm just so frustrated by how there are so many stories of women that are suffering needlessly at the hands of these arrogant men and yet women have to endure a lifetime of trauma from it and men usually get away with a slap on the wrist, it really just makes me so sick to my stomach, I hate it so much.",2
11085,This is so disturbing. It says that they are killing chickens that are still awake during it. It's like they like torturing them. Why can't we be like Europe?

Relief is being distributed better than after the last hurricane since the capital city was less affected and learnings from the previous situation were used to make some improvements. But getting food and water purification tablets distributed, and fairly, is a big problem. People are crazed with hunger and become violent, or give in to despair. Cholera is revving up. These are the immediate problems, but shelter, long-term rebuilding, voting in the upcoming election, and other issues lurk too. Somehow we have to figure out better relief efforts for natural disasters.",2

I for one never plan on using them.,2

How was the mother able to walk into it without knowing that it was broken? The other tenant's reports about the condition of the elevators in the past are also alarming.

11101,"After reading this article on some of the federal prisons, I am extremely upset about the treatment of prisoners in these facilities. The way that the guards are treating the prisoners are literally inhumane. I understand that the prisoners are convicts and felons and really deserve to be place in prison as their punishment, but there needs to be accountability for the actions of the guards mistreating them and basically treating them like animals. Prisons are about rehabilitation or at least they should be, but in this article with the countless reports from prisoners about very distressing and disturbing situations I can't fathom to understand what goes on in the minds of these guards running the prisons. We seriously need to do something about these conditions.",0
11102,I saw a horrible story about a turtle on line today. A man took a hammer and beat a large turtle to death . He broke the shell on it's back and crushed it's head with the hammer. I hope they give that vile excuse for a human being the maximum sentence. I love turtles. They are so unique and cool to watch.

It is no wonder that religious minorities in Syria supported Assad. At least he protects them. He probably has committed atrocities, but it seems every side has committed atrocities there.  This murder was in Jordan, and even though the Jordanian royals come off as urbane Westerners, there is obviously an undercurrent of extreme Islamism in some of the population. Christians are murdered all the time around the world, but this rarely gets attention in the US media, which is completely corrupt.",2

It will happen forevermore into the future no matter who wins elections from here on out. The issue is not opposition so much as it is the ability to organize against someone anymore. Using the internet, it is quite easy to gather a group of thousands and perhaps even hundreds of thousands to combat against something vile or unwarranted. The problem is Trump wasn't even given a chance. Now that things have played out, perhaps some of those people were right about their hatred or grievances but its entirely unfair to subject any president of our country to this before they have even been given the chance to lead.",0

In this society the tendency to demonize everyone for the actions of a few sets a very dangerous precedent and things like this can happen.  Every person should be judged on their own merits.  Saying all cops are bad because of what a few have done is so insane and the public outrage leads to things like this.  I don't know for sure what this person's motivations were but there have been enough instances that some don't see law enforcement as people anymore and it makes their job so much more dangerous and we need good cops to do their jobs to keep us safe.",2

He did not know his route. When he got lost, he kept moving instead of staying put. He also failed to let rescuers come to him.  He could very easily have been stayed if he had made all of these error s and just stayed put. I hope his friend doesn't feel too much guilt over this.

It wasn't as well written as a lot of journalism in this area, but it was pretty interesting to hear the stories of the two cases that were detailed. One involved a violent adult who went on a rampage and shot an ex-girlfriend's child and another person. The other story involved two kids who were left alone in a home that had a lot of guns and one of them ended up shooting and killing the other, claiming it was an accident.

Generally speaking a story like this is sad to read or hear about but these are celebrities.  Who cares about their problems?  They are no more special than anyone else.  People who get caught up in celebrity custody battles need to get a life.,0

I remember hearing that they were killing hostages one by one on the news, and just bursting into tears at that point. This article really vividly reminded me of that moment, it's really sad.",2
11221,I am shocked and saddened by this earthquake. What a sad and terrible tragedy. I feel so sorry for all the victims and those affected by this event. I can't even imagine how devastating this must be for them. What an incredible catastrophe. My thoughts and prayers and best wishes go out for all the many people affected by this tragic catastrophe. I hope that everyone stays safe for the foreseeable future. I am still in shock.,0

I hope Keith can make his plan come alive and stop the invasion of the mice. My concern is if they start getting off the island and migrating to other places. I live far away in America, but I sure don't want to run across these giant bird-eating mice. No thanks!",0

It brings out the selfishness of humans and their inability to share this wonderful world with its other inhabitants. These animals should be properly cared for, and perhaps some of the financing could come from fines imposed upon the people who illegally absconded with them in the first place.",2

He was a special wolf from a pack in California that was endangered and had a tracking device on him so they could monitor his movements. he had already traveled 700 miles looking for a mate, which is what wolves do when they come of age. They are trying to hold them accountable for the needless and cruel slaughter of wild animals. I forgot the name of the group. But I hope they stop them. Animals need more laws that protect them from evil garbage people.",2

11226,I'm just in shock at what I read. All these migrants attempting to make a better life for themselves ironically met an untimely and unexpected end. We must think about all these poor people who are forced to flee and find better lives. We must learn to accept them instead of having them forced to survive.,0

Since she is stronger, she will survive, then they can bring her back to complete health, then do it again for the next 3 years, then keep repeating it until she dies. I can't comprehend why people like this do these things, but there is a special place in hell. I don't buy the mental illness garbage. OF COURSE she has a mental illness, but that shouldn't automatically imply protection from justice. The very nature of murder, especially of this kind, requires a mental illness to a certain degree, so no pleading insanity. Torture her as she tortured that poor boy.",0

It is clearly and issue but they'll make a vaccine for those who don't become immune by way of their own system, then the virus will become resistant to the vaccinations and it will be a never ending up and down cycle that we see all the time.

11230,it is really diheartening to read about these immigrants from this article who drowned.  it makes me feel anxious and upset how the whole ordeal happened.  it is a terrible occurrence that this had to happen at the mediterranean sea.  thankfully there were some survivors.  the fact that babies were lost makes it that much more emotional to read all of this,2
11231,This is such a sad story. I blame the owner of the dog. She should not have had her dog off leash. A big dog like that can really scare someone. Not everyone is a dog lover like we are. Poor Macie had to feel the pain because her owner wasn't doing the right thing. Perhaps the fine for having dogs off leash will result in people not taking their dogs off leash when they walk. Take them to a dog park and let them run.,2
11232,"This is so sad. Many of you know I use to have a lab. They are often the most sweetest, loving dogs around. I cannot imagine why someone would take out a gun and shoot one.

I know some people will say it is not a person, but this is still another needless murder that occurred because of a gun.",2
11233,Apparently an actor was found dead in a Talk show host's home. Not sure what occurred but you have to feel sorry for those close to them. I certainly don't want to be negative and assume that demons finally caught up with him or an assault of some sort occurred but it is odd and they clearly have family who lost a loved one. It a shame that someone with talent to entertain and act would lose their life at a younger age and I guess it could be any of us but it's sad foor thoose  who knew him and my heart goes out to them.,2
11234,"Jeez, who would have thought that those little guys could wreak such environmental disaster.  But this is a classic example of people who think their one indiscretion (dumping the fish in the river) is harmless.

11235,"I am sharing this because I wish people can understand what humans are doing to the environment and how its actually affecting our climate.

11237,"Did you see where Republicans are trying to stop black people from voting. It's like its 1800's again in the U.S. and the rich are using the Southern Strategy to stop likely democrats from voting, using the divide and conquer strategy of trying to turn the people against each other instead of who they should be against. rich republicans.

Upward of 10 billion gallons of mud filled with mining waste buried towns in the Nov. 5 dam break that has been described as the worst environmental disaster in Latin America’s largest country. Nineteen people perished. Across 5,000 acres — about six times the size of New York City’s Central Park — the onslaught of mud crushed thousands of trees and wildlife.

It is through this interaction with humans that animals are even given moral consideration. As the outcome, animals are becoming even further tarred in society. Humans have and are continuing to handle animals as if they are some kind of material goods. This is considered as being immoral, as animals have their own lives, and they think, have feelings, can feel pain, require love, happiness, and everything else that humans have.

A part of me feels a deep relief – the last two days were very difficult and she had so much to cope with.

11248,"The first time I tried to commit suicide was the most painful. Two months after starting my first year of highschool, boys started treating me like a prostitute.  My “friend” at the time told everyone that I enjoyed the rape. That I wanted it. I was called a whore and a slut by my peers. Older boys attempted to have their way with me. I started acting like one. I sent nudes to anyone that would ask. I believed I was only needed for sex, that I wasn’t worth anything other than my sexual appeal. I was 13.  I was self harming any chance I could. My wrists, legs and chest were full of cuts. Eventually self harming didn’t help anymore. I didn’t want to live anymore. The thing that pushed me over the edge was when my “friend” invited me to a group chat with her minions. They talked about me like",0

Smart people make money and are good at business. Just the way it goes. Jew, Jew Jew, I'm sick of all of the Jew hate. OTOH people have a legitimate concern to fear that Trump being elected will cause problems like WW2 did. After all Jews tend to be Republican and likely donated a ton of money to Trump and they are more powerful today than they ever were. Still whatever, it doesn't affect us.",0

Something has to be done about it, and I think it starts with getting rid of corporate contributions to politicians and getting rid of lobbying.

I don't think I would want to go to that place again to surf if I was a surfer.  I think people need to be cautious when surfing.

The banking industry is rife with issues like this, so it comes as no surprise that someone was trying to take advantage of the system even in an international organization like the IMF.

I tend to think the body inflicts various levels of physical and psychological pain over the often somewhat lengthy process of dying.  One type of emotion I can partly relate to is the idea that the party (life) keeps going on, but you have to leave.  The idea of no longer consuming new information or experiences.  The process of dying inflicts bad emotions on me, but thinking about being dead does not inflict many emotions on me.

Yes, they know the risk involved, but because of other countries bombing their land out they are trying to find a better and safer situation for themselves and for their families.

This is just crazy to me and I hope that it never actually happens and that the people who live there can fight it. It just seems to me that this is just another case of government over reach. These politicians are probably going to benefit financially somehow from this deal . It is the only explanation that makes any sense to me. Why else would you destroy a whole community?,2

There were language/communication issues between her and the robbers, she thought they wanted her jewelry, and they wanted her money.

More of the women they're talking about voted for Trump than Hillary. I guess they never asked women if those allegations bothered them or were important. I know that you told me after the Access Hollywood tapes that you didn't care about that stuff, that policy issues were more important.",0

11372,The story that was told in the article that I read was I thought was pretty sad considering it highlighted a better time in life where things were not so violent in the world. There are so many acts of terror these days that it is hard to keep track of and the incident described feels the same way. Unfortunately there are so many bad people in this world that feel like they should be able to do all these bad things to other people because of some message they are trying to spread but really just causing a lot of pain for everyone.,0

A populace that is so uneducated on health and nutrition that they don't know that it's mathematically impossible not to lose weight at over 350 pounds on a 1200 calorie a day diet.

He had told Fox news that the muslim security collaborated with the attackers at the concert hall.,2

She weighs 500 pounds, so obviously a 1200 calorie diet is going to cause her to lose weight, the fact that she can't find a scale to weigh her doesn't matter. You don't need a scale to tell you're losing weight. Measure your body with measuring tape. But then I got to the article about the Mexican students and found it really horrifying. I can't believe the terrible things people do to one another :(",2

But it’s also really interesting to see how all the stakeholders in a big industry like coffee are aware of climate change and its dangers, have been for a while, and are actively working at trying to minimize its impact on their business. And yet, others have their heads firmly buried in the sand and pretend nothing’s happening.",2
11392,"So I just read an article about climate change, and it is awful. It seems very few people are trying to stop it and it is maddening.

11394,Big businesses should really be held accountable for where the bailouts they receive really go. Yet the government don't really enforce any rules.

I am outraged!,0
11395,The shark attack described was distressing.  I'm glad to know that the victim is okay.  There is something about shark attacks that seems so unexpected and primal...really frightening.  At the same time I can appreciate how people want to protect the natural wildlife in the area.  Its a tough call.  I know the measures they take will never be perfect.  I guess I'm on the fence about what they're doing to protect the sharks.,2

We should be providing help to get people out and a safe place for them to stay, but instead we just let them die, getting bombed in their cities and drowned at sea. So I'm angry about this. What kind of society have we become when we let this happen? America should be doing so much more, to help these people. It's callous to think ten thousand is somehow being responsible,  being moral.

11400,This is a bizarre story.  A man bashed a turtles head with a hammer in self defense.  He is being held on 5000 bail.  The only part of the story I find interesting is that the man dragged the turtle into the middle of the road and left it there. I'm not sure I believe the man.  Claiming self defense against a turtle seems crazy. I think the man could of just left the turtle alone and not of been in this situation to begin with.,0

11404,Here is another interesting story but this one is about squrriels and leprosy. In the UK they found that red squrriels are getting leprosy and that never happened before. The article also mentions that Armadillos get leprosy also which I didn't know.

These protests ignite racial tensions but will not bring back the lives of innocent victims. What needs to be done here is clamping tight on the police force-punishing them appropriately and in the harshest of form if they take an innocent life or harass black people for no reason! They need to undergo training and psychological evaluation before being allowed to go out there and deal with criminals! They need to be psychologically stable and clear of racial bias, otherwise they are not suitable for this job!",2

I have Native American heritage and feel that this population should be cared for by our government before segments of third world countries.

The country is pretty much tyrannical at this point and the government is over-reaching into everyone's lives. Reading about the protests and issues going on makes me feel grateful to be out of that country. I really hope the people can oust him and replace it with a better government.,2
11441,Its crazy that really intense and sad situations are happening around the world but here in USA were worried more about who made it passed the first round of the Voice or whats the latest viral videos.

11446,"The real problem with people born with critical illness is that we try so hard to give them a normal life. However these people are not normal. And to force them into feeling normal while a nice sentiment, is hardly productive. Instead we should focus on how these people can live differently than trying to merge them into general society. Society it's self is a disgusting community of work till you die. No matter what it is you chose to do. Take Autism for example, we try so hard to normalize them. However with my experience these people are brilliant in their own ways that we can't understand. They see things in an alien like manor of ultra basic instinct. This instinct should have it's own way of flourishing instead of bowing down to the rest of us.",0

Hacking and nothing is safe, not you, not yours, not your loved ones, is kind of a way to make people afraid and keep reading. In reality, this guy just kinda sent an email to these celebrities and said hey i need your password this is google from google, hurry its an emergency and they fell for it.

Twenty-seven years is a long time to be married, and I think this translates to a long period of healing for the parents.  Its not a good situation.  I also wonder about the impact of the divorce on the daughters' image of the security of marriage for their own lives.  It seems that the parents did try for a long time.  I wish them well.",2
11461,"Hey! So I just read this article about the internet in schools. I guess that several years ago, the government came up with this program to get internet and technology in to schools and make it possible for as many or all students to have access to computers and the internet. However, according to this article, this program is not working the way that it was set up to work and students are not actually benefiting from this program that costs A LOT of money! I was upset to read this, as I feel that the internet can be such a valuable tool in education, but then I really wasn't surprised at all to learn that the government isn't doing what it has been set up to do or what it is promising us citizens it will do. Doesn't the government just infuriate you and make you think you could do better?",0

Sometimes I still cannot believe that we lived through 9/11, especially because before that I had never even heard the word terrorism or knew what a terrorist attack was. And now, we live in a world where we are constantly hearing about possible terror attacks or terrorists regularly on the news. It just makes me absolutely sick that this is the world I am raising my kids in and that we have to live in fear of someone trying to kill us or setting up bombs to surprise attack people. The fact that we cannot live a carefree life anymore because of the sick minds of individuals scares me daily and makes me wish I could keep my kids in a bubble!!!",0

It turns out that low level employees were signing people up for products and things that they did not need. Sometimes they were even forging signatures to get this done. Now before you jump to conclusions and thin k that this is all the employees fault let me fill you in some more. Management came up with a quota and incentive system where employees(who don't make very good money to begin with) would make extra money the more people they signed up to these new accounts. So basically the people in charge over there thought that it was a good idea to screw over their account holders and give their low-level employees crazy quotas, all so they could make more money. Then its the workers getting fired.",0

They go to college, which is hard work, but then they expect a job to be handed to them. The real world isn't after high school, its after college.",0

You'd think all the different factions would finally agree to disagree and move on but instead they just seem to want to keep killing.

I do not understand how a group could commit such a mean act of violence. The group that shot the fireworks were never caught, which makes this story even worse. People should be able to express their views in safety.",2
11517,"This is just more violent nonsense from the outrageous middle east.  Honestly, I dont care any longer.  All these people clutching to one religion or another (often just as a mask for their rage) and killing each other out of tribal animus.  It hasnt changed, well, ever.  I dont expect it to change now.  Its hopeless because people are just ignorant, solipsistic apes.  I just cant care any longer about these idiots.  Its horrible and tragic but it's all so preventable.",0
11518,"I don't understand why we continue to fight this battle. People in our military are getting killed.It is not a good sign that anything positive is happening over there. I hate reading about military deaths. It is so sad that people have to go out there and fight. It seems unfair to me that their families at home get to get the phone calls that their love ones have died regardless of the circumstances. We need to do a better job at fighting batters we actually need to fight, vs fighting the battles of others.",0
11519,I feel that it is a common thing to have intentions misplaced. The article seems to discuss what the difference is between perception versus reality. I love to understand what part of reality I can dissect to understand how I can do better myself. For example if a family member tells me that something does not look right on my body I usually take it off. For example I had a bad weave on my head one time and I took it off after church and never wore it again. I love to always look my best and if I don't I will usually correct the situation. The perception of fantasy is often when people get in trouble because they perceive it as reality. I have always received constructive criticism from my parents so that I can also distinguish the difference as well. Parents should often be the critic ok.,0
11520,"Kisii is a real tragedy. Many people are dead, and more people are severely injured. The drilling is likely what caused it, and the developer should be held responsible. He has caused much pain and suffering. Kenyans deserve better, and since he didn't listen to NCA warnings, he should pay for what he did. The other buildings in the area should be thoroughly tested to see if anything can be done to prevent this.",0
11521,"Hey look at what I have been reading into. I want your opinions on this matter at hand. So civilian casualties are starting to rise as Iraqi forces push into Mosul. The vehicles screeched into the small field hospital on the outskirts of Mosul carrying desperate loads: soldiers injured in battle as well as men, women and children caught in the crossfire of Iraq’s war against the Islamic State. Now you know me. I would be in terrible trouble this is not a way of life. Why are were even in war. Why harm our children. This has saddened me to no end. We do not need, want or find any peace in war!",2
11522,"Trump should really not underestimate the blacks. They got complacent after two Obama terms, and didn't come out in force like they should have for the election. Now that Trump is in office, I don't think there's any way he can win the black vote, and that would definitely sway the election in 2020. I really think Trump's days are numbered, whether it's impeachment or defeat in the next election.",0
11523,"It was sort of sadly ironic to see the part in there about ""we don't think he'll win"" considering what followed. All of it, sadly, still rings true, day after day. There's been no apology, only a doubling down on the kind of bile, arrogance, and ignorance that was on display since day one. I feel bad for every woman in the country who has to live with someone like that as their president.",0
11524,"Officers shooting at unarmed black men needs to stop. I know there are some really good cops out there, but the bad ones are the ones giving the good ones a bad rep. More officers should be vetted before they go to the academy. They need to have better background checks. I completely understand if someone was armed and the officers were in fear of their safety for them to shoot, but if a white officer shoots at an unarmed black man for no reason, that's wrong.",0
11525,A mayor and his bodyguards in the Philippines was shot and killed by local law enforcement. He was in to the illegal drug business. He was elected to take a stance against drugs. It's really weird to think that a mayor was the one taking part in the illegal drug trade. It makes me wonder who can you really trust. He was said to be a narco-politician. Sad to think the people can't even trust his own mayor.,0
11526,"An agency that I can't recall the full title of just released proof of the fact that the earth is getting warmer. Yeah, it was only a couple of degrees but that's how it starts, right? Something is causing the world, the United States in particular, to warm up. I know where I live that it's seems a lot warm than it was even 7 or 8 years ago. The seasons used to be predictable, but they don't seem to be that way anymore.",0
11527,Whenever kids are involved in a nasty breakup there are never any winners. The person who gets the short end of the stick in this case will probably be the child who will be forced to split time and maybe even countries between the two parents. People should try and consider the child's feelings before using them as pawns in a custody fight.,0
11528,A lot of these news go unnoticed I feel. We have war in Syria and war everywhere. We have accepted it as a part of the world. It's such a shame that it's like this. Conflict has always broken us down and it's never been necessary. I don't know for how long this war has to continue. But I really feel sorry for all the lives that's been lost in this conflict.,0
11529,"This is another example of the racism in this country, the officers again use extreme deadly force against a black person, just because he was black, he was not a threat and yet they shot him without hesitation. We feel more insecure with officers around than safe, and still they can kill people and get away with it.",0
11530,"I don't understand why there is so much hate. It's like every one lives in their own little bubble seeing everything foreign to them as a threat. They take up selfish ideology because they don't like something, instead of just disassociating with it. This greatly saddens me, for I have seen the world in all it's wonder. Where the majority of people just want to live in peace, without boundaries. Yet this idea of cultural heritage has become disastrous further dividing people. If only more people could set aside their petty ideals, and just accept each other as other humans. Instead we classify and further separate ourselves due to every difference. I would prefer to just die, than put up with such cruel disgusting people. I am disgusted with my country of Americans. We deserve to burn....",0
11531,I just dont have many feeling about this article. I guess i feel bad for the teachers but it doesnt exactly bother me. I am not too concerned with affairs in other countries unless it is about war or peace and political things. Packing up and having to move your live away in just a few days is very hard and i guess i feel some sympathy about that.,2
11532,"A perfect example of greed and selfishness-British government is willing to kill innocent creatures in order to drill for oil, regardless of consequences! Instead of exploring other alternatives, such as natural energy sources, they will go and march their way to Africa and claim innocent lives just to put money in their pockets. I wonder if the majesty Queen, the mighty Queen of England, would appreciate of someone suddenly marched into her palace and started drilling for oil?!!! Absolutely disturbing-total disregard for nature and living creatures, nothing but pure greed regardless of the cost!",2

12439,That seems very trivial but do you mean that he still doesn't seem to know you?,2
12440,That's quite unfortunate. I feel for you as I used to live in a small town where jobs were scarce. It's rough when there is no competition,2

12521,"Well, absence always does make the heart grow fonder. It will make your relationship a little strained, but the time you guys do get to spend together maybe will mean more and you can enjoy it more.

12530,Oh no. Did it eat something bad?,2
12531,"Oh no, why is that?",2

Just try your best to let go, I know it's tough- but people everywhere are way more successful then you and way less successful and you don't compare yourself to them I hope so why focus on one random guy just because he's your brother.",2
