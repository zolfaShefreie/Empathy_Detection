I am 30 years old. I just got fired from my low skilled low wage job and I have no money saved up. I dated one girl from my previous job. She enjoyed being around me. She laughed at my jokes. We even went on dates. A month later she doesn't want anything to do with me. This is what fucking killed me inside. I'm just going to go back to being quiet. Because if I open my mouth I will ruin the vibe of where ever I am. Motivation is pointless, because in the end, I will always be me and I fucking suck. I want to die.",1

My moods range from suicidal and self harming to just feeling out of sorts and not at peace with myself. Sometimes I go months without feeling like that, sometimes it seems to come about every few weeks and lasts for weeks at a time. I don't know, I sometimes compare myself to my boyfriend who has a team of psychologists and psychiatrists working to diagnose him, whereas I just went to my family doctor, filled in a questionnaire, and boom got labelled with depression. I wonder if I'm faking it or blowing my feelings out of proportion, especially comparing it to more serious cases of mental illness. Does anyone else ever feel this way? How do you deal with it?",1

People who aren't willing to talk to you and help you aren't worth keeping around. Believe me there is a friend out there who is willing to listen.

At this stage you should be seeking treatments and seeing if you notice any differences in how you feel. I'd recommend running outdoors for 45 minutes at least 5 times a week. This is actually more powerful than antidepressant medication and without unhealthy side effects - on the contrary - it strengthens connections in the brain which are responsible for feeling good.

They trust me with their secrets, their problems, and value my opinion enough to ask for it. Reverse the situation. Aren't you glad when someone comes to you? The thing is, not everyone is built for that. Especially, I have found, it can sort of weird people out when the Rock, the Stable One, the One Person In This Messed Up World Who Has Their Stuff Together needs help.

While your issues might fall onto deaf ears for people your age, IBD isn't going to be something that's going to prohibit you from living and leading a normal life.

Do the things that make you happy, make you feel something, as long as they aren't harmful. Spend time with your family, your friends or animals. Maybe with yourself or nature.

869,Same at the moment. But realized that the way to deal so we can truly escape the pain and emptiness is by dealing with it. We want to ignore our pain so we have to deal with it but that never works out. So deal with our problems head on and TRULY acknowledge them. Of course the hard way to go because going to hurt so much but after that process we will be free of our pain. We really escape the pain by going through it.,2
870,Have you watched Samurai Champloo?,2
871,"Because of your depression or your partners?  My ex broke up with me because of hers. At the time she said she still loved me but needed to get better (really true, she was a nutcase). We recently talked after a few months of NC and her getting leveled out on anti-depressants. Her hurt was not the same as mine. Her emotions were flat-lined. Anhedonia. The sadness, anger, frustration, confusion, despair that I felt are emotions she was incapable of feeling. I know this because I was severely depressed myself years ago. Even now since she is on SSRI's, and with it being months later, I don't think her hurt is even close to what mine was. I think her hurt is more in regret. I honestly doubt she will ever truly hurt over this breakup - by the time she's off the meds and capable of feeling those raw emotions again, it will probably be a total of 1-2 years since the breakup. She'll only have to deal with regret - if even that.  Of course some cynical side of me wants her to feel what I did. I want her to grieve the loss of our relationship like I did. I want her to think about what we had, let those good memories fill her with the positive emotions we had together, and have them followed up by sadness over the realization she lost it. But when I really think about it, I know I don't want that to happen. She cried enough when she started sinking lower into depression. The outbursts, the frustration, the fear of losing me. I remember how much that happened. She hurt too, it just happened for months before the breakup, where mine was after.",0
872,Did you think you might die from it?,2
873,Sounds like your having a tough go. So am I and misery loves company. Do you have a doctor who can look at trying something else?,2
874,"Yep, this is pretty common. Usually when you've been depressed for a long time, it starts to become a part of your identity. I assume normal people feel a range of unpredictable emotions throughout the day, but the state of depression is pretty unchanging and there's a comfort that comes from feeling sad/numb/apathetic all day/week/month. I used to fight my depression and look for things to make me happy...when I realized it was all meaningless, I gave into my depression and it's now my closest friend. As sick as it sounds, I wouldn't want to lose it.",2
875,"I was getting better around last November after 2 years of being a shut in. I got a job, moved out and on with my life, and was doing good. I started to decline about 4 months ago. I'm back to where I was. I moved back. No more job. No more new friends. The only thing that keeps me going is that this right now won't be forever. It's for now and it's so debilitating. I leave my bed to use the restroom, grab something to eat back in bed, and thats it for last week at my just getting here lowest points. And over time the time spent like this will get shorter and the time spent on that high curve will go longer and farther. I don't feel that in any way. I'm lucky to have had a decade of therapy to make me feel like I know it tho. Doesn't change the feeling at all but gives me a shred of hope to hang onto. I'm really sorry you feel that way mate. Some people don't do well with that kinda energy but there are a lot who will not care too and help you with their energy. My dad is neutral and doesn't care, but can't really help. My mother won't even be around me when I'm down. Even told me she can't stand it. Just having the 2 people I have right now for when I am down tho helps me a lot.

Your present company, your listening ear, your genuine love for her is likely to be more helpful than if she starts to feel like she's just a problem that you're trying to solve.  Beyond that, sometimes we need a little push to get counseling, or just eat a bit better, or get outside. Those things don't usually solve the problem in isolation, but they can help build her positive momentum. You can't be her savior, but you can help build a ramp towards something.",0

894,"My gut reaction is that if you were just insisting in wallowing in misery, you wouldn't be wondering about this.",0
895,"Sorry to hear that. Obviously a very painful experience. Of course you're not crazy for feeling like that makes you wonder about your value as a person, but to get through this life you'll really want to get to the place where you understand other people's behaviors are a reflection of them and not of you. I'm not trying to suggest some stupid mind-trick here, of course when someone chooses another person over you, you are going to have thoughts of worthlessness and insecurity. But even if someone you are with realizes they'd rather be with someone else, it doesn't require them to cheat on you, they could just be an adult and end a relationship before doing something behind someone's back. Human love is fickle. There's no way to ever say that anyone who decides to spend time with you owes it to you to honor that choice forever, but it certainly doesn't mean they have to cheat and lie. This advice has stuck with me ever since I heard it on a podcast; don't ever expect other human beings to be rational, or to assume they are playing by the same set of rules and understandings as you are. They lived so much of their lives before you were ever it in, you have no idea if this behavior could be a reflection of something somebody else did to them in their past or whatever. You can't blame yourself for other people. Otherwise a total stranger could walk up to you on the street and punch you, and you'll spend the next week wondering what you did wrong instead of identifying that person as a violent crazy person. Regardless, it isn't exactly the most logical part of your mind that is going to feel rotten about this for a while, so no amount of information is going to make it feel better right away. But try to love yourself, and work on coming around to that understanding that other people's choices do not say anything about you, only about them. This action means that they are a cheater, not that you are worthless.",2

906,"Oh I know. In my opinion the true reason that you, me and about 90% of people with depression feels the way you portrayed in this post is because out of all those people who are support. no one really understands on a deep, emotional, and philosophical level how this disorder ruins your life and makes it miserably painful. The ONLY way you know is if you have experienced it yourself. Once you get truly depressed you enter the void. Some people are only in that void for some brief time, while clinically depressed people like ourselves live in this void. That support group doesn't speak our language. That's the fucking problem. They don't know the void. They can only read about the void, but they don't live in it. The support group approaches depression in the same way that males know what it's like to go through childbirth (no this is not a political push either way). It's just stating, THEY DONT but they can read all about it and try to imagine the pain, but they can never truly feel it. The subjective nature of emotions and life makes it beyond Fucking difficult to find people who know what you are truly talking about at your personal level.",2

Not drinking is one the better things I've done in my life, and the benefits seem to compound the longer you go. My brain seems to work considerably more efficiently, and I continue to feel and overwhelming sense of clarity that wasn't present when I drank.

919,"I think people are meant to regularly bathe. Like we have probably been bathing while still hairy and grunting. I wasn't raised the best; one thing is that I was never taught to bathe regularly. It was normal to bathe once every 2-4 weeks growing up. Basically, I never had it ingrained into me, which led to being super hygienic to the point of irritation and skin problems during puberty, and complete abandonment of hygiene during my intense depressive periods.  So during these periods I would go as long as I could possibly can without showering until it was literally affecting everything I did, usually 4-6 weeks. My dirtiness would get into my eyes, and they would burn like hell. I got more skin problems from the build up of dead skin: in grown hairs, dry scaly skin, acne, etc. My hair had issues too: unhealthy and wiry possibly from an unhealthy scalp and follicles and dandruff. My dick had some infection and itched like hell. I also looked like shit too and was never prepared for events that forced me to go outside which made everything worse (I would hide and wait out people who potentially could see or interact with me, for example). I also was dirty and made my surroundings just as dirty, and I smelled bad, but luckily I don't have volatile BO.  *Anyways*, just saying that there are some serious consequences to poor hygiene that I wish someone told me about.

930,"It's a terrible feeling when you try to hold on to even the most minuscule things that bring you any slight amount of joy, and one by one those things get taken from you.  What I try to do is work back on a route to the thing that would lead to getting the one thing that could be right. i.e. something that costs money makes you happy, but you don't make enough money; need a way to make more money; dedicate all free time to applying for better work. Or, feel lonely and haven't got anybody; need to find somebody to stop feeling like that; need to know best places to find somebody; research ways to meet people and put self into that situation. Or feel worthless; being of use to someone or something would make me feel less worthless; dedicate myself to making myself of use to someone who needs somebody; use free time aiding charity or institution where people need you, and you can feel needed.  Honestly, I know it's not that easy a fix, and there will be more bumps to overcome. One of my larger problems is isolation and loneliness, and even having looked at places to go, I still haven't found the courage to put myself into a situation to meet people. But generating a simple starting point where you can do something easily achievable, even just through reading online about how to get started, can make you feel proactive and start to get you into a more productive feeling that maybe it won't be like that forever, and that there is a physical, tangible, mortal way to deal with the situation. So, I would recommend pick a small goal that CAN lead to some form of happiness and work towards that, rather than try to envision this great milestone of achieving happiness in one big leap. Helps you take it day by day a little easier, and I hope that would make each new day, if not better, at least consistent for you. Feel better soon, bud.",2

938,"Yes, I have. Currently I am a mess. Nevertheless there used to be a time when I was a mess, but still had a reason to pick myself up and get my shit done. If you want to study and pass your exams, this is what I did:  - Get busy studying now (within 15 minutes). No excuses to eat/drink a bit. Not going to the bathroom. Just study. Phone away. If possible laptop/computer away. Do this for at least one hour and take a small break to get fresh air if you want and drink some water. NO PHONE. Then back to studying. Again one hour or more.  - After studying go for a run (I don't care if it is 11 pm) or exercise in some other way. - Eat healthy. You crave good tasting food? chocolate? chips? No go. When you go to the supermarket, fast food is not an option. You will not spend your money on that shit. No chips, no sweet stuff, no special drinks. Fruit/vegetables/carbs/meat/fish/bread/milk/yoghurt. Healthy stuff. Lots of water.  - Go to bed on time. Get out of bed on time. - No thinking! Only actions.  - Do one thing at a time. No thinking about tomorrow or the next hours. Just about the next minute. What are you going to do now? Shower? check. Dress? check. Breakfast? check. Go to library? check. Study one hour? check. Have a small break and drink water? check. continue. - If possible, study with other people - (added) When I get stuck, it has been VERY helpful for me to discuss this with other students. This has been very difficult for me, because I have a crazy amount of pride and am very ashamed of showing I do not understand something. Nonetheless, it has helped me so much to just discuss a problem where i got stuck with someone and then see the light which enables me to continue studying (instead of procrastinating till everything went to shit).  This doesn't solve the deeper problems, but it probably will get you through your exams as good as possible. At least, this is how I managed to finish my undergraduate years. Not healthy, but it worked. Also you will probably find that by being so hard for yourself, setting boundaries and actually following them, you will start to feel a lot better about yourself and gain confidence. This is a trap, do not get satisfied with yourself. Being satisfied and giving yourself more space to slightly cross your boundaries again is equal to getting on the slide that will get you right back into the pit.

Sure things suck, most of the time for longer than we'd like but there are alot of things that make life on this planet right now worth living. I personally am not religious.

I'm not at all a people person and i have a family full of happy go lucky dimwits who talk nonsense and gossip repeating the same routine like that i what life is. That's not what i want.

My only communication is with my clients by email. I do leave the house, but it's only to go to the grocery store or for a walk - by myself of course. I read on the internet about all these wonderful holiday destinations that i'd love to visit, but I can barely afford it and going by myself is not enticing at all. Just sick of it..",2

I've seen this too many times, where people spend days after days trying to find the one. That just now how it works.  Although it is true that if you don't look, you won't find in most cases.  You shouldn't fear not finding love. 'Cause that's just not how it works.  I wouldn't say love finds you either, that's also not how it works.  I wouldn't ponder too much about not finding the one or love.  Time will tell, it will come.  During that time, try to be alright with yourself by being just yourself.

It's not about getting a certain grade for social life, or any other aspect of life for that matter. You are not a failure.  Not having friends worsens depression, depression inhibits the ability to make friends. It's a cycle that needs to be broken, and I recommend getting medical help to tackle depression. Eventually you will get to a point where it is easier to make/maintain relationships, even if it that progress seems small at first. Keep up the fight.",0
980,"Yep. In conversations with my therapist, we have discussed me having some kind of attachment disorder around this. I am constantly seeking and craving connection with others. I can be at an airport and be thinking about connecting with other people. We traced it to childhood stuff (no surprise there) of abandonment and alienation, unmet emotional needs.  Then when and if I do connect, my expectations are pretty high since I am willing to do whatever to reach out to the other person and increase the connection. When that is not reciprocated to the expectations that I have (because they are not trying to fill the massive hole that I am), I feel rejected and then shut down. I internalize this sense as a rejection of me as a person (they don't like me, I'm not worth liking, they got to know and discovered i'm no good). Rinse. Repeat. That's my pattern at least. Knowing the pattern helps, but it doesn't mean I can always identify it and stop it. Thanks for letting me share.",2

If I couldn't remember to brush my teeth every day (and I really kept trying) how would I remember to do anything else? How would I remember to learn, be good at school, how would I remember to do all the other things I kept forgetting? How could I be anything more than terrible, like I seemed to keep being. Even when I succeeded why did I always feel like I was so useless and bad at everything the moment I didn't? Why did it seem to keep getting worse? It was such a tiny thing, so inconsequential a moment, but a demon was born in my mind that day. He's lived there ever since.",0

I thought that if I could go through physical pain, then I can go through mental pain. A physical scar is easier to understand that an emotional one. Having to tend to my wounds to stop the bleeding and cover them up distracted me from what I really wanted to tend to and cover up. There was a couple times where I self harmed because my thoughts were too overwhelming while I was trying to fall asleep. Afterwards, I would spend some time in the bathroom alone, taking care of my bleeding and by the time it was all finished, I forgot what I was thinking about. Self harm was an effort to try and beat life at its own game. If life was beating me up, maybe if I did a better job at that than life then maybe the punches life throws at me seem so bad. since moved on from this.

For instance, tough love can potentially push a suicidal person over the edge. There's a reason those things are mentioned in the sidebar. Treatment should be left to the professionals to deal with on an individual basis. This sub is more of a support group, meant for encouraging each other to hang on, to keep fighting, and to point people in the right direction if and when they seek professional help. I'm sincerely glad you beat depression. What worked for you, though, may not work for everyone else (or even anyone else). It's a very personal and individual experience. And that's where you should have gone with this submission. You should've just shared your story. Talked about your depression, talked about your journey through it and how you beat it. Instead, you rolled it out like a sales pitch for snake oil. This is dangerous territory, because when you say things like I beat depression and you can too, here's how..., you are selling people hope. If it doesn't work and somebody spirals down and harms themselves or worse, even in one single instance, you are at least partially to blame for selling them that false hope. Again, that's why we leave treatment to the professionals. Please, I can't stress enough that you follow the rules and guidelines in the sidebar. They are there for a reason.",0

Everyone else more important than you was busy, so you (bottom of the list) will have to do.  It hurts and depression makes it hurt x100.

1044,"Yup. In my experience sertraline was more intense than (es)citalopram the first few days and I started slow at like 12.5mg.  It's really the first week - actually about the first 4 days - effect. The thing that requires the black box warning because it's a surprise if no one tells you to expect it (and not everyone gets it so powerfully).  If it's too intense talk to your doctor about cutting back and moving up slower (I've settled on 50mg and that was after titrating up). Try splitting it up into at least two doses so it doesn't all hit you at once - sertraline's got a relatively short serum life and I'm preferring a morning and afternoon dose.  ... and during this 'jittery' period try to take it at least 4 hours before bed so you'll have a shot at getting some proper sleep.  It gets a *lot* more boring (but still potentially helpful) once your body adapts! Right now all sorts of stuff is going on with your serotonin and it's pretty much the 'psychedelic' part. Once your system adjusts the idea is that the drug is holding a 'buffer' of serotonin in the synapses so it's there when you need it for more even moods and less discomfort, but until that settles down it can be pretty trippy and stimulating (especially with sertraline that has a nice extra dopamine stimulatory effect, which is pretty helpful offsetting some of the more annoying SSRI side effects in the longer term).  So if you feel like you're going to jump out of your skin now - yeah, that's normal, and it passes in about those 4-7 days (for me, anyway). Also heads-up that.. yeah, with sertraline, those days included a lot of nausea and (ahem) intense GI effects for me too - that passes too.",2

I am very lucky. Very few people get this level of treatment. Any number of genuine suicidal thoughts is too many. Everyone gets depressed, but when you stay there long enough to consider life actually painful to live you have depression. It can be really hard not to play mental illness Olympics. But someone else struggling more does not take away from your own struggle. Your feelings, your illness, are real. They're valid. They have NOTHING to do with anyone else's struggles. Just as theirs has nothing to do with you. Please please please remember that.",0
1057,"Aye, it is. I feel the same way, I got hired 7 months ago, and was depressed for 2 years before that. I hate to admit this, but some days I cry like the little bitch I am in the shower and on my drive to work. But guess what, I haven't missed a single day of work aside from 9 day vacation that I took scattered here and there. I have seriously one simple trick: you go there no matter what, don't give yourself a choice. The more you sit and wonder the harder it gets. Funny thing, my supervisor almost cried today at work and was complaining in a high pitched voice xD. It kinda brightened my day LOL.",0
1058,just tired. like a zone-out feeling but 24/7. foggy.,2
1059,"I would say plan around your depression. You gotta give yourself more time to do stuff because there will be days where you just do work. If on average you give yourself 2 weeks to do a paper, give yourself 3 weeks and push yourself to work when you have good days. Know that going to be tiring to try to work as soon as your depression temporarily lifts and just take things in small increments. Write a paragraph a day for 3 weeks and or write two paragraphs when you miss a day due to depression and voila! Same results, different pace, depression included and worked around. Practice self care and indulge in the fee things that make you feel okay. stay in your dorm/apartment constantly. Seriously, even if you go to the library for a few hours a day, it helps with isolation. If you like to write, start roleplays with people on geeking or rolemance and reply when you need a break from academic writing. Otherwise indulge in low energy hobbies. And try to eat 2 meals a day even when you feel like it. It makes a difference. Overall, the transition is going to be rough and even more rough for you because of depression so try not to get stuck in a loop of bad habits. Break your routine if not making you feel good and professors are more understanding than not about late assignments and group projects. Be candid with them. Tell them you have the disability accommodations et but working on them. Good luck!!!",2
1060,Sorry to hear you're feeling this way  Can you see a doctor or a psychiatrist? They can help you get anti depressant medication.  They will also probably tell you to make an appointment with a therapist and to see a therapist regularly.  Hope this helps,2
1061,"You didn't ask, but this is a public forum, so I'm gonna comment. Here are some things that might help: food, sleep, water, fresh air, a shower, getting dressed as if someone was coming by, listening to music. You can obviously pick and choose the ones that apply to you, or the ones that you feel up for, or none at all. It's all alright. Whatever you do, don't beat yourself up, because I'm sure you're doing everything you reasonably can be right now. I hope tomorrow's okay. And don't hesitate to reply with an update later, yeah? You'll be okay &lt;3",2

1070,"Definitely. I want my ex back more than anything, we broke up over a year ago, she's got a kid with someone else now and it hurts a lot, but it was my fault. I wasn't the nicest person to be around sometimes, I did a lot of good in the relationship, but a lot of bad too. I'm not proud of it, I'm ashamed of it, I regret it all, I hate myself over the things I've done. I think that's what makes the breakup worse, knowing that it was my fault, that I could have saved it if I had just stayed on my medication. I keep trying to convince myself she broke my heart, but I broke both mine and hers through my actions. Still doesn't make it any less painful and I wish I could just end it all right now.",2

It is not normal for a 24 year old good looking, well educated man to be feeling this way - but I have never felt right in life. The biggest thing that kills me is that I have never experienced a relationship or genuine friendship in my life. I find myself completely and utterly alone every day. My only communication is with my clients by email. I do leave the house, but it's only to go to the grocery store or for a walk - by myself of course. I read on the internet about all these wonderful holiday destinations that i'd love to visit, but I can barely afford it and going by myself is not enticing at all. Just sick of it..",2

I don't have an uncle or aunt who hang out with me. You can choose your friends and to me friends are more important. They kinda replaced my family. And it's horribly wrong when people ask you those questions I'm so mad right now fuck man That guy has 0 empathy. I know you mad af but after you calm down try to look forward and hold onto yourself. You don't need them to save you. They should be supporting you, if not then not. Don't give a shit about them. It's a beautiful world but some people have 0 empathy. I may sound cringe but empathy is something I learned with 3 or 4. I don't know what is going wrong with some people",2

It took me a while to accept that it's not wrong to reach out and want someone to care and help you.",2

Although i've been eating, just a lot less than normal,i still just want to lay here and just forget about everything, but laying down leaves me alone with my thoughts always thinking about what was.

1085,When did you notice you're feeling crappy again?,2
1086,"Exactly. Don't worry OP it will be ok, if one of your conversations got awkward just shrug it off, it doesn't fucking matter. If you see someone alone , go talk to them. If everyone is in a group just be like hey guys what's sup , again don't try to be weird just be yourself. People will accept you I promise. It's best if you try taking to one person, it has much better results so go do your thing",0

I don't remember the website off the top of my head but just google it. I hope this helps! Good luck :)",2
1092,"Shit, my dude, other people will always have worse (or better) lives than us. That doesn't invalidate your pain. I look at it like this:  As a kid, I would throw tantrums in the grocery store if my mom wouldn't buy my favourite cereal. A couple years later, I could handle that, but I cried when I got cut from the basketball team. A couple years after that, I was nearly suicidal when my girlfriend dumped me. I eventually learned to handle rejection, but full time work drove me to drug abuse. Now, I can handle working 50 hours a week.  The point is I have always had terrible coping skills. None of my problems have ever been that bad, but they have been the biggest problem I ever faced. They always seem overwhelming because I don't know how to handle failure of rejection of really any kind of pain or even mild discomfort. I am a wimp.  And yet, they still treated me at the hospital - multiple times. I was never told to suck it up; I was taken seriously and given the help I need. It isn't about the external circumstances, it's about how we react to them. So if you need help, *that's okay*. You aren't any less of a person. You are worth just as much as anyone else.  Someone losing their home or family in Texas doesn't mean your problems are irrelevant at all!",2

We need to do something about people who don't act like humans anymore. They lose all empathy for others and just want to end their life in a cowardly way.,2
1155,"Just came across an article that involves shootings and people being killed. The story is about a white person in his 50's if I am not mistaking that was bothered by the loud music that was playing in a Durango by some black teenagers at a gas station in Florida. There was an argument regarding the music and some exchange of words. The white guy shot the 17 year old black kid 6 times. He was convicted for life with the possibility of parole after 2 years. He was denied. These situations are complicated and they are happening quite often lately. There should be a limit on many things, and one of them should be the guns. There should be a stricter gun control .",0
1156,I can't believe that there has to be so much violence and bad in the world.  The part of this article that really got to me was that the Muslim women were being raped and that doctors and nurses who wanted to help the people there were being treated rudely.  It would be awful to have to live under these kinds of conditions.  It would be awful to have the prices of food go up because of blockades and other reasons.  It would be stressful and scary.,0
1157,A moron Arkansas cop left her police dog in the patrol car in the middle of summer and the poor thing died. She's on administrative leave while the incident is being investigated.

She killed herself after a long suffering of depression. She repeatedly looked for for professional help and because ""missed opportunities"" she decided to kill herself. It is hard to imagine someone would be refused this kind of help after so many referrals. The professional mental health services have admitted the error and said lessons had been learned and changes have been made since the tragic loss of the journalist. It's sad that there is such a price needed to pay for changes to be made.",2

They are making these allegations of Islamophobia and all kinds of crazy notions of hatred against gays, etc. What do they expect people to think when every time we hear of a bombing, it is a muslim.  Do they expect people to say thank you?  I don't hear any Islamic leaders speaking out against any of the terrorism.  Are we just to sit back and say ""thank you sir, may I have another.""  Not only do I not hear any Islamic leaders speaking out against it, I don't hear any muslim citizens speaking out either.  As to the gay and transgender stuff, I will speak out against whomever I wish.

1162,I was sad to hear that a woman was critically injured Sunday evening in a multiple car wreck in the Clinton area of Prince George’s County. It seems like these things are becoming more common.

After that maybe we can plan to picket or have a demonstration at the capitol building voicing our concerns. Do you feel the same about this that I do? if you dont I will get someone else to help me or I will go it alone.  I just feel so strongly that something productive needs to be done and fast.

You would always feel like it is going to happen again.,2

Everyone kept talking about how horrific it was and what a terrible tragedy it was. I feel really bad for these people and it really makes you wonder if you should go to a park ever again. You're suppose to have fun at these places but you never really ever think about actually getting hurt when you get on these rides. Those poor people, they just wanted to have a nice afternoon and it just ended so badly.",2
1180,After reading this story I think the right decision was made. It seems to me that the man had no reason to shoot at those kids just because they were playing loud music. Sure music can be annoying but no one deserves to be shot over it. I don't think that any changes need to be made to the stand your ground laws. This was a simple case of someone making poor choices and now needs to pay the price for their actions.,0

I wonder sometimes what must possess refugees to do this. Is there no other way for them to escape? Why do they risk their lives when they know the numbers of people who die in situations like this? It must be awful where they are coming from for them to risk it all. I mean, look at that star soccer player. She was like royalty in her country and a celebrated athlete. If even she took the risk and died, what must it be like for other people?",2

The difference between why more black people get shot is more of them do crimes. Add to the fact that black families tell their kids not to trust the police. Don't run, Don't fight back and do what the police officer says and you have a lot great chance of not getting shot. I can't stand these black people who feel like they have it so bad here.

The target is to keep temperature rising by more than 2 degrees Celsius or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit",2
1228,"The dwindling wilderness is due, in part to humanity’s activities such as logging, agriculture, mining, and of course, oil and gas exploration. The research team from Australia’s University of Queensland said the Earth has lost nearly 1.3 million square miles of wilderness. They’ve defined wilderness as an area with no human development. Dr. James Watson of the University of Queensland in Australia said globally important wilderness areas are completely ignored in environmental policy, and much has been paid to the loss of species. Without any policies to protect them, they are “falling victim to widespread development,” he added. Dr. Watson also revealed that humanity has one to two decades to turn things around.",2
1229,"I've never heard of this person or this talk show, have you? Mostly I find this stuff kind of boring, and although it's sad for people to lose their jobs, this happens all the time, and to people who have probably earned a lot less than these people, and who have a lot less prospects of being reemployed. Shows are cancelled all the time, so I get kind of annoyed with this kind of news.",0
1230,Check out this article.  Remember I was telling you the other day about that man from the bank who approached me in the market?  He was asking about my savings plan and long and short term goals.  He also asked about my mortgage.  I bet he has the same pressures as the bank workers in Pennsylvania.  So shady!  I would never want to work under that kind of pressure.,0

1232,"I just read that poaching of rhinos for ivory has gotten so bad in South Africa that they've begun expanding and now have anti-poacher armies. I say good for them. The animals can't fight back, but hopefully the army can deter poachers. I know the poachers do it because they can make a lot of money, but I just don't understand it. Big game hunters/trophy hunters and poachers are one in the same to me. I think they are both ridiculous reasons to harm or kill any animal. The anti-poaching armies have a scary, but, I think, extremely necessary job.",0
1233,"This is the type of thing that really scares me.  I would be very interested in viewing this video.  How in the world does one shoot their own relatives and two police officers? What gives this person the right to take someone else life? Those people may have had children, mothers, sisters, friends, co-workers, and now they are dead, and for what?  How did this individual go so long without being apprehended.  Sometimes the system really confuses me and upsets me.  I wish they would have caught him sooner and kept him alive so he could explain his actions.",0

1236,"Boring. I don't care, again, because it doesn't impact me or anyone I know directly. These people should move. I sure as hell wouldn't stay there. I do find it hilarious that this is happening in California, where they seem so concerned about every possible social issue under the sun, especially taking care of people who are here illegally, yet there are parts of the state where actual citizens can't drink the water like they're living in a third world nation. Then again, given Commiefornia's stated desire to secede, they might get to live their third world dream.",0
1237,I just read about a tragic 10 story building collapse in a town called Kisii. I'm distressed about this news because they're still searching for survivors. There's been a report that 9 are still missing. I hope they're able to find these unfortunate victims. It was horrifying reading about the accounts because people could be heard screaming and shouting for help. I'm hopeful that they can help find any remaining survivors. This is such an unfortunate event. The cause was due to bad building construction as the developers have cowardly gone into hiding. Experts said a recent drilling underneath the building triggered the collapse. This is horrible to hear. Could you imagine if this happened to the office building we worked out? Such awful and careless planning resulting in lost lives.,2

When the Arab Spring happened and then the Libyan war and now the Syrian war (et cetera) there was very little meaningful opposition to it from the Democrat-voting side of the aisle. Republican lawmakers just pretended to be opposed to thwart Obama, if they even did that. In reality, the whole government supported ""removing Assad"" and because that objective was considered SO important, now we have the current situation of extreme tragedy.

I have worked for a company for over 30 years and in the early years, the company cared about its employees.  They treated us like family.  The last ten or fifteen years have been so difficult.

I am not certain about the suggestion that wild bananas be used to produce new variations, tho. I have a hunch that this would drive the cost of bananas up, which is concerning. It might be possible in someplace like the U.S., where we have money for R & D, but I worry about how this would affect people in poorer countries.",0
