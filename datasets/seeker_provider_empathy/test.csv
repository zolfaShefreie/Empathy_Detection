We all see resignation as a taboo, but how long does a person have to fail before it becomes evident that person will fail until he, she, they or whatever else will continue to fail, lose and forfeit until they are dead?

What concerns me more than the presence of these lows, however, is the complete absence of highs. In other words, I feel no joy whatsoever. I really don't remember the last time I did.  Despite seeing a counselor regularly, working out 2-3 times each week, meditating daily, and trying out multiple medications, I've seen no improvement in that regard. It takes a lot for me to do all of those things, so it's obviously pretty discouraging that I'm not seeing any results.  Anyone else have this issue?",1

This may seem like useless advice, but it can greatly help if you tell the other people exactly how you're feeling and ask them to try and help you. Nobody will ever be inside your head and able to experience exactly what you are feeling, but by talking to them and letting them know, you can help them to understand you. Sometimes we have to do the hardest part of reaching out ourselves. I had to tell my best friend I was feeling suicidal, but by telling her she helped me turn my life around. She just didn't realise. It's never easy to do, but I can promise you that you are so much stronger than you know, and there are always people willing to listen and to try to understand what you're going through.  Lastly, I hope you don't die. Not until you've been able to live the life that you want, the life that you deserve to have. I'm sending you love and luck.",2

Then I zoom out to the building and picture all the rooms filled with all the other students.. Then I zoom out and picture the exterior... I zoom out and imagine the city view, then the state, then the country, then the hemisphere, then the whole planet, suspended in the I stay there and I just watch it spin slowly.

Take it from me as someone who has used self-harm, an infection is not the sort of pain that helps with emotional relief! I also recommend other methods, there are plenty out there that can cause some pretty gnarly pain but are far, far safer than cutting. Are there any taps in your house that have overly hot water? Boiling water shouldn't be used as it will scald and is just as prone to infection and other nasties as cutting, so just try clenching a fist under the regular hot water for a few seconds. On the other end of the scale I found the grabing an ice cube and squeezing as tight as I could helped!

Being terminally ill for the past 7 years (Im 42 now) the physical pain of a slow and horrible illness has led to my depression and desire to die. It is up to my wife though. And for her I live every day in hell. When you have even one person to keep you going, it can be enough.  I am a lurker here and I read posts to give me perspective. Rarely can I physically reply. But what my experience being bound to a bed 24/7 has taught me is that once I made my peace with dying, I became indifferent to everything.  For myself It's been tough to see people truly depressed to the point of wanting to die. I am very empathetic, but my depression is a symptom so its hard to understand. The one thing I do understand though is that the last thing you want to hear is Don't do it!!! Call this number... or other similar programmed/indoctrinated responses.  So just know this... The world and life can be one big shitshow... So it helps to keep toilet paper handy. Let your friend be your toilet paper and be your friends toilet paper. It will be enough.   Lastly... Just remember that no matter how bad life feels (and is...) even I am artificially grateful for the fact that I have a far better life right now (suffering from *pain and bound to a bed), than 99.999999% of all humans to have ever lived. Just try to make it as long as you can. Know how much worse it can be. And let your toilet paper know that you need them to help clean up some shit. Then when you are ready to go.... You will know. But I cant see it happening for you as long as you remain attached to someone that you can call a friend. So give yourself a list of requirements that must be met for you to end it all. *- Pain so severe that causes me to vomit my own feces at times as it sends my body into shock.  I wish you the best. I hope you can suffer less in time if possible. You and I are here right now... That makes us stronger than those who gave up yesterday. (And if you do one day come to the realization that you must go, make sure to do it in a way that allows your organs be given to help others. It helps me knowing that maybe I will have something that can give a healthy, long, and amazing life for a person who is still able to live it. )  Just think about making the list... And go tell your friend, right now, that you love him/her... Even if they are not quilted and only 1-ply thickness. You both need that right now... The whole world needs that right now.

It's: *I drink to forget, but I've drank so much I don't know what it is I have to forget. So I drink, just to be sure.*  Alcohol and drugs have become a habit for me and I can't really live without them anymore.

Sure things suck, most of the time for longer than we'd like but there are alot of things that make life on this planet right now worth living. I personally am not religious. I think once your dead it's lights out and I very much enjoy consciousness. I only felt what it was like living without it once or twice and those were not pleasant experiences. I'm still technically Depressed, I have been most of my life and likely will be until it's over or I find what it is i need to do with myself to get there. What helped me go from uber frustrated to content is to continue to evolve. I cut off everyone i knew and reevaluated what I want in life... Apparently it's living in a van and not staying anywhere long enough to feel stagnant. I'm not at all a people person and i have a family full of happy go lucky dimwits who talk nonsense and gossip repeating the same routine like that i what life is. That's not what i want. To be happy you need to forget about everyone and their bullshit, and be who you are where you are. Experience what life is, don't waste it and don't throw it away before you've lived it fully. I'm stuck right now, been hibernating as my little brothers personal housekeeper because my anxiety drives me to near agoraphobia. But once i get out of here I'll take all the lessons I've learned on /r/vandwellers and start my life as i know it should be and hopefully that brings me piece of mind for once. That's what works for me, but if your not an antisocial INTP then you might not want to live in a van lol. But I'm sure there is some way you see life should be... There's an entire world out there, look at the room around you and remember that's less than a microbe in the grand scheme of things. Do what what want do what drives you, not what you think is expected of you. It's your life, you are the one setting the standards and accepting them. Fuck everyone else.",0

Being able to feel things as deeply as you or I can is something to be cherished and protected and put to good use. The world could use more empathy, you know?  It's okay to hate yourself too, btw.

I suffered from major depression but I also live by a philosophy. Life is so bullshit - but it's those small moments that make it worth it. Those small, sometimes dumb, moments where you just smile thinking about it. Our conversations, graduating school, seeing a new member in your family being born. It's the small things that bind us together and make it worth the suffering &gt;It hurts like fucking hell. But this life was worth having if it mean[s] coming in and making you smile, even once.

Some people were kind about it, others pretended they gave a shit (more likely for the look how sympathetic I am play card.) Recently I've been pretty out with my highs and lows. My highs get a lot of love but as soon as I show my lows, I notice a massive difference in support. It's almost like they go out of their way to avoid the lows and reality of it.

1051,"Let others suffer with you.  The biggest struggle with depression is the isolation box it confines us in. It fools us into believing there is no one that will understand. Tells us not to burden others with our problems. Demands we keep our pain in the shadows. But this is the nasty cycle that keeps us locked in to our loneliness. We feel lonely, hate that we feel lonely, feel stupid for looking weak, and decide to keep it hidden.  We find worth in our connection to others. Not because they decide if we are worthy or not, but simply because our ability to contribute what is in us is only useful in light of others.  I'm not sure of your circumstances, but I can tell you that I have been in your shoes. I have felt completely cut off from the world. I have laid in bed night after night, wondering why I should even be here. I have been so lost and hard on myself that I couldn't even look at my face in the mirror. I have broken down in just about every room of the places I lived and expected it to never change.  But it did. Not all at once. It took time. But when I began to open up to others and let them struggle with me and offer help. And by also helping others myself. It doesn't need to be family or current friends. Finding support is a hard thing these days. But there are great places now to get help working through the pain of living.",2

Those things always run out and I find myself being broke not long later, having to lend or beg relatives, yadda yadda yadda. I hate it, but love it at the same time because that always seems to pay off. Sure, I don't have the right mindset for this thing - drugs are bad, and so on and so on but whatever works works. Just make sure it works and doesn't make it worse is my advice.",0

Maybe you could try to find something to distract you. Learn a language or skill or something. Spending time with friends. Make new friends. It is good that you have some long term friendship. short term friendship is not bad too.  Dont know if you do this or not. A mistake i made is that I used to watch a lot of comedy. Comedians would make a lot of self deprecating jokes, they would say things like : nobody likes them, they are unattractive, got terrible personalities, they have messed up life, blablabla in a very funny way. And i actually took it serious (by this i dont mean i get offend by jokes ) And proud that i am relate to that. So i always lookdown on myself.

It took me a long time to understand that I can't go back in time and fix anything. It is fucking terrifying to feel like you've messed your life up but please trust me when I say that it's ok to fuck up. You are human. We all are. I have found that being alone with my thoughts was a big factor in triggering urges to harm myself or get stuck in my thought loops about how useless or worthless I am.

I read it in a really bad period, and for the first time in a long time I felt really good again for a couple of hours. When those couple of hours came and went and I started to feel crappy again - I read the book again. It's not a big book, took about an hour and a half to read. I carried it everywhere with me for the next few weeks and whenever I could feel myself getting low, I'd read it again when I had the chance. I found over time the low moods became less and less. I also deactivated all my social media accounts while I could get my head around it all. I started buying more books on mindfulness and regularly read them. Besides understanding the present moment, it also helped me figure out my issues. Like, the root cause of my issues. As soon as I started to accept and own my feelings and the reasons I was analysing everything, it lifted a massive weight. I'm not saying it's a fix for everyone, but it sure as hell is worth a try.",2
1066,Are you feeling that you would be judged? Judging yourself? You should not be ashamed for taking actions that might help you be happier.,2
1067,Sorry you are feeling that way but How do you know it was a lie? In My experience most people don't compliment unless they meant it. Excluding family or friends who may just be telling u what they think u wanna hear of course. Who complimented you and in what context?,2
1068,"&gt; These feelings of anxiety and depression will never leave. I feel the same way. It's hard too because when someone does believe in you, you can't even tell anymore. Maybe you think it's because they just want to be nice or maybe it's because of other reasons, idk. Just don't keep fighting. If the life you're living isn't making you happy, it's not what you want, why don't you change it? I'm not saying it's easy, or that you even can.

1087,"You should, but in this society you don't.",0
1088,"hi there, forgive me if I'm wrong with regards to what you are referring to. How I understand your statement is that you try to relate to others but rather do the latter. If this is the case, I want to let you know that even though sometimes you feel you are compelled to relate to other because of societal pressures, you really don't and it depends to what extent. It's important to be who you are and be with people where you can be who you are. But that doesn't mean your depressed you is who you are as a person. Your depression is only a part of who you are, not your defining being. Don't define yourself as 'a depressed person' but more so 'a person that has depression right now at this stage of my life.' Because depression goes away or can be managed very well where it doesn't intrude on your life in a daily or constant basis. You are much more than your depression. Try to take smell steps that you are comfortable with and learn some coping strategies in managing depressed feelings. Ideally it'll be great if you can see a therapist but I understand that has it's own restrains. The key thing is to never give up on yourself because when you believe, there will be a way out of this. I always tell others that healing isn't easy but it's worth it because you are worth it, whether you feel it right now or not.",2

I don't even want to put her through all of that for the rest of her life. But at the end of the day I just want to go home and share my life with her.. and she's not there. She's done so much for me but it makes me feel so unwanted that this is the end of the line. Like I'm just a burden and despite all the love she has to offer, I'm just too screwed up for it to work.

1096,"Depression isn't something you can get rid of by wishing it away or telling someone you have it. A lot like an addiction you have to fight to get out of it. And it's hard to tell what path is right or wrong. Talking to people does help. But you need to find someone you can talk to. I couldn't talk to my mom for the life of me, my sister would tell my mom or tell me I was wrong, my dad just gave me a look and didn't know what to say besides he cares about me. Once my mom knew the extent of my depression she became better at helping me. She listened and didn't judge. She let me talk and told didn't lecture but reassured my decisions. She went out of her way to make me feel more confident. That's the person you need to find. Also try writing your feeling down whatever you feel on a peace of paper what ever is on your mind. Write it in chicken scratch don't worry about how ty write just write what you feel. Then throw the paper away. That used to help me, not as much as my mom did but I did help. Life isn't something we can live alone although a lot of us want to, I wish I could, find someone to confide in that supports you.",2

Might try again later. Valerian root: Calms some people down. Doesn't do much for me. Rhodiola Rosea: Apparently gives you more energy while keeping you calm. Maybe a bit more energy for me but could be placebo effect. St. John's Wart: Supposed to be a natural antidepressant. I am thinking of trying it soon. Magnesium: Helps some people (assuming deficiency exists) but I have not tried it yet. Alcohol: Works great to calm social anxiety in a moment! Don't consume if taking prescription drugs. Consume in moderation if you need to drive home. Marijuana: Can really elevate mood, depends on the person. Can be combined with alcohol for added effect. Don't drive at all after using it. Don't use if illegal where you live or your employer drug tests. --- Lifestyle: --- Exercise: Some people rave that being active reduces anxiety and depression. In my case the gym is actually a trigger. I do enjoy going for a walk on a nice day though. Diet: I have started eating better and less. I have lost substantial weight and feel physically better. The sense of accomplishment and feeling better about my body has probably helped my depression. Travel: If you can afford it take a vacation and go see the world. Go alone so that you can discover your true self and not be at the whim of another person. It was an extremely positive experience for me. ---",0

But I'm never excited these days. I can't even remember the last time I was. Even when I decided to lose my virginity to a prostitute when I was around 30, I had some concerns but I wasn't excited. Birthdays and partys, I knew I couldn't wait for some when I was in my early twenties.

I never knew, that it was that obviously. No one ever told me that.  I answered: I guess plenty of people know that something isn't ok with you, but most people just care about their own shit or just don't know what to say. If you wanna talk... I'm here.  She ended the dialouge with Thank you....  And she never wrote me again since then. I felt bad somehow. On the one hand, I just wanted to help, but she refused it somehow or I scared her too much.

But don't let things ruminate in your mind. Worrying about them over and over does nothing to help you. *Depression thrives in rumination*. Try looking into mindfulness meditation. It's not spiritual garbage, it's literally training the neural pathways in your brain to put less weight on particular thoughts, so that you don't get stuck in negative feedback loops. It takes time to change your brain structure, but it can be done. Another thing is to find distractions.

It would be better if your body was introduced longer to the 15mg (2weeks) then bumped up to 30mg, but I see no complications or issues with being bumped up to 30mg this early in the game. Side effects of Mirtazapine are that it will make you tired, so the motivation and everything may be an issue with your adhd... Again look into vyvance. You may gain some weight also, that is a common side effect. Also some anxiety could occur, but that is rare. important to read up on your meds when you receive new ones.

It's really the first week - actually about the first 4 days - effect. The thing that requires the black box warning because it's a surprise if no one tells you to expect it (and not everyone gets it so powerfully). If it's too intense talk to your doctor about cutting back and moving up slower (I've settled on 50mg and that was after titrating up). Try splitting it up into at least two doses so it doesn't all hit you at once - sertraline's got a relatively short serum life and I'm preferring a morning and afternoon dose. ... and during this 'jittery' period try to take it at least 4 hours before bed so you'll have a shot at getting some proper sleep. It gets a *lot* more boring (but still potentially helpful) once your body adapts! Right now all sorts of stuff is going on with your serotonin and it's pretty much the 'psychedelic' part. Once your system adjusts the idea is that the drug is holding a 'buffer' of serotonin in the synapses so it's there when you need it for more even moods and less discomfort, but until that settles down it can be pretty trippy and stimulating (especially with sertraline that has a nice extra dopamine stimulatory effect, which is pretty helpful offsetting some of the more annoying SSRI side effects in the longer term). So if you feel like you're going to jump out of your skin now - yeah, that's normal, and it passes in about those 4-7 days (for me, anyway). Also heads-up that.. yeah, with sertraline, those days included a lot of nausea and (ahem) intense GI effects for me too - that passes too.",0

1200,"I'll hit you with the two most powerful stats I learned: Less than 25% of the people who attempt to kill themselves and live, ever try again. Ever. Only 7% of people who have attempted end up dying by suicide. So, chances are what happens is a lot of regret for the pain the action can cause others, but also the realization of how many people do care and would help and support if called upon.",0
1201,"I feel similarly. I'm not on here all the time, but every couple of months I find myself coming onto this sub just to read through posts and see if anyone else out there gets it, or to try and comfort someone/lend an ear to listen to. Please hang I know whatever you're going through is tough, something I won't even pretend that I can put into words, but you can and will make it through whatever it is. Just trust and hold onto that with everything you've got.",2
1202,"I wanted to have a kid for selfish reasons, I wanted a reason to live and I wanted someone who understood me. I feel like no one in this world can understand me and therefore no one is willing to put up with me, if I had a kid I could raise them the way I was raised and they would have the same genetics as I so I feel like they would have a chance of understanding me. Also it's pretty much a guaranteed way of having a companion for 18 years, and if you play your cards right it's someone who will tend to you in your old age and sit with you as you die. All that being said you'll notice I used past tense wanted instead of want and that's because I got hit with several physical illnesses that make it near impossible for me to have a kid (or even take care of a kid) and even if I were miraculously cured tomorrow I wouldn't want to risk passing on these illnesses and causing someone to suffer as much as I have suffered.",2

1213,currently in a relationship. I keep thinking going to breakup with me or cheat on me. My anxiety fucks it all up.,2
1214,The reason I use to cut is I couldn't point to a part on my body and say it hurts here. It made me feel better at the time but it wasn't a real solution. You are in pain Broski. If that was me I would think that I had maybe an extra bad day/night and tried to fall back on old habits.,2
1215,I share your thoughts. My therapist suggested that the reason why I could be so thin is because my body burns so much energy in my brain because it is constantly going around around. It's such a pain &gt;: It would be nice for once to be calm.,2

Achievements help us to feel a little less shitty - we did a thing! Yay But also when we help others we help ourselves. - We remind ourselves to be positive, we read commends and upboat new ideas, where we may even add them to our own ideology. - To learn about the struggles of others we feel indifferent which is comforting - maybe we arnt as weird and broken as we tell ourselves?

1217,You're thinking is pretty warped. You haven't tried everything that's clealry illogical. How have those things failed? Seems isn't a definitive answer. Are there specific things you tried for a set period of time and the outcome never changed? Dealing with depression isn't what it looks like. There's no magic set of actions that make it go away. You learn to tolerate it better and manage your mood. What do you think you need the most help with?,0
1218,I'm convinced that I was born depressed. As a child I cried more so than other children my age. I still cry and I'm in my mid\-thirties. I think I did read somewhere that some people are born with a gene that makes them more susceptible to depression but it doesn't necessarily mean they will have depression when they get older.,2

1223,hard to see our impact on society from a single moment in our lives. We downplay our contributions or sometimes we never even know that a small act of kindness affected someone. Or just being around helped them get the the day. Your not worthless or a mistake. Your life matters a lot.,2

1225,I'm sure you will see your way through. Just don't do what I did. Don't rush I to a relationship and don't have your head in the clouds thinking that its going to be heaven on earth. Don't be blinded from your emotions and always pay attention to reality.,2

So, perhaps medication works for Bentley, whereas Allison exhibits no improvements despite numerous boosts to her dose. Maybe Allison has an abusive partner that's affecting her mental state. In that situation she would benefit from distancing herself, as well as seeking professional counseling/therapy...But I digress. In your life, it might be productive to identify that things that worsen your mood. Maybe you need to change your environment, catch up on debt, etc.",0

But I also do not understand why they would be so careless and wander off on a trail where it is clearly marked that they shouldnt be leaving.  If they would have paid more attention and didnt carelessly not listen to rules than this situation could have been avoided.,0
1240,Hey I just wanted you know that I read something disturbing this morning in an article. There were bombings and people were killed over fuel. This is alarming and out of control. I'm feeling so many emotions right now. From upset to angry. I don't understand how people can blow other people up over something so trivial and stupid. They were just wanting fuel!,2
1241,"I just read an article about the presidential campaign trail that focused on how sexist one of the candidates is. It's important that these issues are brought up, especially when it's on a national stage like this. I'm glad to hear people are publicly voicing their concerns and even revealing the troubling incidents they went through involving sexism. I hope after this political race is over, we can all reflect and learn to treat each other better.",0

Farm attacks and -murders which see journalists having to write these reports with words I cannot even begin to imagine the sickening feeling of. Words like “boiling water poured down 87-year-old farmer’s throat for hours on end,” and “his wife and two teenage daughters were tied with barbed wire in the bathroom, after which they were repeatedly raped, burned with a hot iron, and stabbed with a sharp object.”",2

The police will have a hard time with this one.",0

There are some countries that are for the poaching of elephants if you can believe it. Some more rural communities say that the animals harm their crops. I've never heard this side of the argument before! I'm not saying I agree with it, but we're over here in America and have a way different perspective on the issues. It's interesting to see how different things are over there.",2
1245,This man lived here almost his entire life.  His infractions in which he was charged with are explainable.  He literally was getting back his only true property from a more than troubled house.

1248,As much as I love dogs I must say this was totally the owners fault.  The rule was the dog needed to be on a leash.  The woman did not follow the rules and the dog ran over to a stranger. The dog scared the stranger as is expected. I have had many big scary dogs running towards me and wasn't sure if it was going to attack me or be nice. The man got scared and shot the dog. Its sad but the man did not know if the dog was going to attack him.,0
1249,"The United States should be ashamed  of how this last election went. It was sad that they could not be fair to other countries in the campaigning.

Some terrorists stormed a newspaper office and killed some people; their have been bombings at the airports and train stations; and a little girl was among 90 killed during a concert at one of their local venues.  As sad as this all is, the most distressing thing is that the country has decided to activate additional measures to ensure their democracy is maintained.

1254,I know that the affordable care act will effect alot of people out there who are already struggling but this is an issue that just sounds wrong to me.

They do most of their hunting on the ice and that how to meet their mates, so it is very important to them. It may not seem important to you yet, but as the Ice melts it will not only hurt the bears it will hurt you too. Rising sea level will hurt people like you that live in coastal areas. I hope you change your mind on how you feel about global warming and the melting of the ice. Our actions may have an affect on the polar bears and I believe we should think about it.",2
1256,"Yuck.  Although I don't think you can say it was particularly disturbing for women because a lot of women voted for the misogynistic ass.

1257,Of course I only know what I read in the article.  It sounds like it could be the ex police officer was trying to protect himself.  The son was already arrested for assaulted the father. I believe the police will investigate the shooting and take the necessary actions. I don't think the police will look the other way just because he is an ex police officer.,0
1258,I don't see how things are still happening like this in this point in time. We can not let this continue. It really makes me sad and fell fortunate for what I have.

1267,I just read a horrible article online about 10 people getting hurt after a huge fire started in an apartment complex in Arizona. That is so horrible I really feel bad for them. The say that eight of the people had minor injuries so that is good that it was only minor. Unfortunately one person had to be taken to the hospital but they are in stable condition so that is good news. Apparently two people outside of the apartment were also hurt by the fire some how. I think they were able to get the fire under control pretty easily though cause it only lasted around 10 minutes. They had to have the gas company come and shut off the gas and apparently they are investigating what could have caused the fire in the first place. That reminds me of the fire that happened at my neighbors house.,2

American women are freaking out left and right about such minor things when we have these poor women being raped and tortured for no reason at all other than who they affiliate with.

We can often do things with unintended consequences that are not noticeable in the beginning.

I guess I can't put myself in that situation where maybe porridge is hard to come by but just knowing that someone died for that seems petty to me.,0
1292,I think it's well known what the CIA has been doing through it's torture programs of suspected terrorists at Guantanamo Bay. Dr. Rosecrans a leading psychiatrist for the Navy was immersed in treating these patients. She worked there for almost fifteen years and had difficulty helping out these traumatized victims after their incarceration.,0
1293,This is troubling as it is unusual to have two people die of this cause at the same time. This seems suspicious as well. I hope the authorities can find some answers so this tragedy is not repeated. I hope the family can eventually find some peace and get the information they need for closure on their loss.,2
1294,"The good news is we live in a place that does not have much air pollution. The bad news is that people that have lung cancer that is exposed to air pollution may have a shorter survival time. Air pollution kills thousands of people each year. Researchers claim that the median survival for people diagnosed with early stages of lung cancer is expected to live 3 times shorter amount of time than those that do not. Of course, we all should stay away from cigarette smoke but it is unfortunate that we have air pollution. They can figure out a way to get to the moon but can not seem to figure out a way to clean our air.",2
1295,"I kind of think this article was written in a tongue-in-cheek manner especially when you read that last line--what a pun! If there is any truth to it, though, what could possible cause these kinds of chemical burns on a shampoo product that should be thoroughly tested when mixed with water in the shower. How could it even happen like that? Is there actual lye in these bottles? I guess we'll find out when the case goes to trial.",0
1296,"If we think we have it bad having to put up with Trump, think about how Mexico feels. This article puts a lot in perspective, but I really struggle with the quote by the Mexican foreign minister saying that Americans chose racism and hate. Don't group us all in one category. We didn't ALL choose this clown to be president. I understand their fears and stress, but that comment really just rubbed me the wrong way. Hopefully both countries can maintain their ties until he's out of office.",0
1297,"Here is another upsetting article I am sending you about a fire and a family. Funny how this bothers me more than the previous one. The parents and the children got out safe and they didn't die and they didn't get maimed or even scratced as far as I can tell but their two cats died and they lost their home. I am a cat owner and they are always ""skitished"" and afraid so my first thought is how terrified they must have been and then how awful the children must feel. The horror of imagining your pet burning (though they probably died from smoke). The children will not understand and it will take awhile to forget.",2
1298,"This story about the shooting at the airport is absolutely breaking my heart.  There is no reason for these violent gun actions to continue to go on.  Can you imagine if this had been our dad or other friend or family member?  I can not imagine what the victims family is going through right now.  The poor people in the airport must have been in a frenzy.  It had to have been scary to not know what was going on.  Especially before everyone knew the gunman was dead.  This one cowards acts caused so much turmoil and upheaval for so many people.  Can you imagine all of the money that was wasted because of his stupid choices.  Between flights being cancelled, rearranged, police officers time.  I wish we could understand what he was thinking and why he did this mess.",2

Fortunately for me though, I never really used that information for personal reasons, i mainly used it for a junk email, so there would be no real important information that one could steal from me.  But this also makes me worried that any other email sites, like gmail, hotmail etc could just as easy be hacked.",0

And people have been so much more vocal and worried about animals for quite a long time, I just have trouble believing that this story is true.  I hope not.  Plus, do elephants really live that long?",2
1301,"I just read about all kinds of rioting going on in Ethiopia.  It's really a shame what is going on over there.  This is an area which has hopes of dramatic infrastructure improvement and new jobs.  Many people and organizations have invested a lot of money and now have to wonder whether they should continue to invest in an area which may be destroyed by rioters.  It's so sad to hear about these beautiful farms and nurseries just being gutted and destroyed.  The farms now have all these workers and equipment with nothing to do.  The farms are gone.  It sounded as if some of the elders in the community tried to calm things down, and it worked in some areas, but other areas just raged on with riots and destruction.  Can't these people see that they are ruining their own future?",0
1302,"You should read this article on climate change. It's incredibly fascinating. Climate change is happening and it's really scary. Humans are causing it. It will soon be a major problem for us all. It affects all life on earth, not just people. Biodiversity has been affected and has gone down. Temperatures are changing for the worse. It's simply awful.",2
1303,"I think it's hard to determine things like this unless the entire program in each community is being monitored. If not, the money spent versus the number of children being taught or learning from this process is hard to determine. I do think that connecting the schools is important though and that children should be learning computers, but by the time they're in the workplace, the jobs may have changed.",2

At least 29 people died in the incident, all in their 20s.One person out of every 88 has been lost at sea trying to reach the shores of Greece, Italy or Spain. That means they're 90 times more likely to die on the journey than an American is likely to die of gunshot wounds.",2

1307,"Ugh. That's rough. I feel so bad for that little girl and she deserves to live in a world where justice is made, but that eye-for-an-eye type justice is so medieval. The guy obviously deserves a very harsh punishment, but this is barbaric. This is the difference between revenge and justice. A 20-year prison sentence makes so much more sense than blinding.",0
1308,"While reading the article, I did not really care too much about the protests made by people in South Korea against their President mainly because it is in South Korea and not here in America. Although I didn't really have much concern for the article I just read, I hope that these protests will end in South Korea.",0
1309,These people are dumb for voting for him. They can't even tell that he's exploiting their feelings and has no intentions to helping them. He's just taking advantage of the situation for his own gain. They'll find out soon and they'll be the ones who end up suffering most from this. I don't really have too much sympathy for them.,0
1310,"According to Dr. Jack Drescher, a leading specialist and critic of conversion therapy practices, there is not just one set of practices understood to be used in conversion therapy. “People have tried all kinds of things because none them really work,” he told The Huffington Post. Drescher also said that the majority of research surrounding conversion therapy has taken place on adults who’ve undergone the process, and there is very little research surrounding LGBTQ youth who have been through conversation therapy practices. “But of course you have anecdotal stories,” he said. “Some children have reported running away from home, there have been cases in the news of young people of when their family found out about them or they came out and the family insisted they go to conversion therapy",2
1311,"Ugh, another example of crappy cops. They think they can get anyway with anything. I've started to pull out my phone camera whenever I see the cops talking to someone, especially if they are a minority. Police brutality is such a problem in our country and it's just so deeply ingrained in the system, I'm not sure what can be done. We need some kind of overhaul of the criminal justice system.",2
1312,"Why do people think they can just illegally enter a country? The article sounds so sympathetic and bias. Why do people act like coming here illegally is not breaking a law? ""They haven't broken any laws!"" Yes, they have. You break the law when you enter illegally! What the fuck! And you got Liberal scholars defending immigrants, repeating that nonsense of, ""They don't break any laws!"" What the fuck? As a Mexican, I am appalled by other Mexicans defending this nonsense and seeing Mexico encourage this illegal immigration shit. Mexico needs to fix itself so that it can house people that won't want to run away from it. Fuck Mexico, they have ruined a lot of lives and they are not held responsible. Quit being politically correct about Mexico. Hold them accountable.",0

1314,"Oh hey, check it out. Another article about the same thing that's been repeated over and over again, but it's not really changing anything. I am just sending it to you because I'm an idiot that doesn't care about what you think. It just goes on and on about meat production and how that's harming the environment. I can't wait for lab grown meat to be the standard, but that's not really in this. So, read away about cow farts.",0
1315,"I just read an article that the U.N. reports that ISIS has executed over 200 people near the Iraqi city of Mosul and is using thousands of people as human shields. The Iraqi forces are advancing against them and as a result, ISIS carried out mass killings, punishing people who had defied its orders. They are even forcing women to wear gloves to completely cover themselves, and accusing anyone who has even a cell phone of being a spy. It seems they are growing increasingly desperate and determined to take the lives and freedom of everyone in their path without regard to civility or even basic humanity. This scourge must be stopped, it is so heartbreaking to read about these victims!",0
1316,"It is a sad world when lives are threatened daily.  let's remember when we here in America were fighting each other during the civil war.  war is hell whether you are on the ""right"" side or the ""wrong"" side.  Both sides invariably lose something.    Does it make sense to have war?  Is it a human condition that we will never be able to contain?  I know these are open ended questions but are we like the herds of animals that migrate and take over others' territories when food and water are needed.   I believe we can be better by accepting our differences and finding common ground for the welfare of all.",2
1317,Sure glad I live in Minnesota and not Chicago. I hear the latest problem is lead in the water. Now they are shutting down all the outdoor fountains. One reason is to protect the homelsss. LOL who are they kidding. Like anyone actually cares about the homeless. We have this pompous rich guy Donald Trump cutting peoples SNAP on 2019 while at the same time cities are worrying about lead in the water to protect the homeless. It's all really annoying. Granted I agree lead is bad but then again some Govt. clown probably needs to do something to justify the 6 figure income they make.,0

I wasn't really a Monty Python fan myself but I've heard a lot about them growing up and it seems that they were a great deal of fun for their fans. I know they influenced and produced some favorite comics of mine.",0
1319,"Well, there was another shooting. This one was in Washington. There is no real motive at this time, but they don't think it was terrorism. Maybe a broken heart? Anyways, it's getting ridiculous how many people are affected with these mass shootings. Just because someone has a grudge or a mental problem.",0

Refugees from European countries are being sent home to Afghanistan, only to see the turmoil first-hand.  And there are problems with resources getting to the people who need them.

If everyone had enough resources to live comfortably, things would surely improve.",2

I'm mad that California is the only state to pass laws for people to have rights to clean water. I know California has water issues with drought, but nobody should go with out clean water. Reading the article, reminds me that this is a world wide issue and we must figure a way to provide fresh and clean water to everyone. Especially those in need.",2
1322,"I agree that this election is stressful. There seems to be a lot of tension between parties. People are worried about what could happen if Trump wins.

People aren’t scared to post when behind a wall on social media.",0
1323,"This type of thing is always largely ignored as it goes on, when people could have known about it but chose not to. Then many years later the truth comes out and some people address it with discomfort, and others still continue to ignore it. The way for real change to come is with accountability. Any crimes that aren't protected by a statue of limitations need to be addressed through prosecution, and they need to look for ways to prosecute instead of looking for ways not to. They should also encourage civil suits, but those are always against the departments and not the individuals. There needs to be reform so that the officers are the ones that are held accountable instead of the taxpayers continually having to make payouts because the police broke the law.",0

Unfortunately we as a nation need to open our eyes up and realize the impact that we are having on our environment.  Even worse is now we have a president who in his own words feel as though global warming is just a fabrication.  This is going to cost us more money in the fire fighting department and we are going to see way worse side affects from this problem.",0

I don't want to make too big a deal about this because it is a different culture and it would be difficult to get the full gist without knowing too much about it.  With that said, it's is pretty worrisome, in this country as well, how much people are telling everyone what they should and shouldn't be doing.  Live and let live is still the best way to go about things and comparing putting on make up on a train to pooping on the train is pretty ridiculous by any standard.",0
1327,"I think in this day and age, there is no reason to be poaching tigers, or any other rare game for that matter. I've discussed this with my friends before, the poachers are generally low status people, trying to feed themselves, and they're selling to the highest bidder they can find. Even if you jail the poachers, more will pop up out of desperation. One day, we'll look back and see all of the greed killing rare animals purposefully, rather than the crappy way we move them out of their territories naturally as humans.",2
1328,I thought that this article was something very hurtful to read. I was reading about the fire and what happened to the place that these people live and it said that these people got hurt and injured and I felt very bad for them. I wish that there was a way that everyone could help along to. The people should be more careful about the fire and see the safety next time.,0

His wife could be a very dramatic person.  She could be giving him a hard time.

1335,I have always thought that politics were a scam and this is another example of politics gone wrong. Every country runs into problems sometimes and in this case they would like her to step down from her position. Do you think she really has a say though or will they just force her to step down if she does not volunteer.,0
1336,This is a completely unacceptable situation. Our military bombs a Doctors Without Borders medical facility and they have the gall to point their fingers at those who were bombed.

YOu never know what might go wrong in this world.",2

1345,I can't believe what a nuisance gold fish can be. The fact that they can cause so much damage to an environment and have no natural predators is crazy. It makes you second guess flushing the fish down the toilet as it may survive. It's hard to believe that they get so big since they are usually just little fish in a small tank. Also it's weird that they travel so far considering we usually just see them swimming in circles.,0
1346,I feel like the world is so corrupt that it no longer makes me feel anything. I expect the worst from this world and only am surprised when something exceedingly good happens. That is a shame that such a gruesome scene cannot even make me feel anything. The world is a cesspool and we no longer have any integrity to show for it.,0
1347,I just cannot even imagine something like that happening. What makes someone do such a horrible thing? And especially when there were children on board? Such a senseless act. How scared those individuals and the victim must have been when that was happening. It is a good thing that that guy was there to help the passengers get off the bus. A tragic event would have been even more tragic had he not been there to save those people. I feel bad because those individuals (including the guy who saved the passengers) are all now scarred for life and their lives will never be the same. Their lives have been turned upside down because of someone else's senseless act and are forever traumatized by it. I hope those victims get the support they need and I hope that the driver's family receives support,0

It is not just up to the USA to stand up and do something.  These other countries (even though they are poor) need to get more educated and help protect their own children and citizens in their own country.

I guess she ordered her friend a coffee before her friend got there and right after she took a sip of the coffee she keeled over and died. Pretty crazy, right?

Everything was legit at first, but as time progressed these poor girls, children really, were denied contact with their parents, tortured, and forced to work for no pay.

1365,"So apparently sea ice is becoming less and less which is a concern four our environment and all I can think of is how it will affect the animals in the ocean.  This cannot be good for the ecosystem.  Or is it? In contrast to the article, i remember seeing a whale die because the ice was so thick and they were trapped. Perhaps neither are good, but how do we fix this?",0
1366,"Honestly I do feel bad for him but at the same time you should not be taking a selfie around an animal that is clearly so dangerous. Pythons are really dangerous animals and I get that the man had rescued the reptile from a local hotel but even still, you need to have your eyes on that thing at all times. I feel like some people are not as responsible as they should be, and that goes for anything. People are too busy spending their life looking through the viewfinder of their smartphone camera and are so busy trying to document everything online in their desperate, never ending quest for more likes and followers that they are willing to put their personal safety on the line, and that's really sad and I think it really speaks to where we're going as a society as well, and it's frustrating.",2
1367,"Crushed to death by a machine that makes recycled plastics into pellets? Really? What a terrible way to die. My guess is that standard operating procedure does not include crawling inside the machine to unclog it. I understand that it is a tragedy, but geez, at some point people have to be held accountable for their own actions. I'm sure there will be a lawsuit, probably a hefty one, but I hope they lose. There doesn't seem to be any reason the company should be held accountable for his actions unless there was a malfunction of the overall systems. I'm trying not to picture it in my mind. Yikes!",0
1368,"Let’s hope those are very isolated incidents triggered by people with mental health issues. It might be that there were crazy things like that happening before but we heard less about them. Still, I’ve been reading everywhere that hate crimes or incidents motivated by racism are climbing. And it’s not surprising considering that bigots are being empowered by people in high positions, some in a very high position…",2
1369,"Hello friend,  It's sad that thousands of hectares of tropical forests in Latin America have been changed from their natural habitat to grow bananas. The rise of different types of diseases that focus on banana tress is alarming. I hope we can find a cure for these diseases before it's too late.  I did not realize bananas were a genetic accident. Lucky for us!",0
1370,This is another story of government overreach.  Big government pushed by authoritarian leftists making a big deal over nonsense and holding back human progression in the name of hippy bullshit.  If a species is endangered it deserves it's fate.  More species have went extinct in the time before humans existed than in our entire existence.  It's a non problem and just how the world works.,0
1371,did you hear about that Indian girl from Kashmir who got blinded by the government with pellet guns that have sharp edges. She wasn't doing anything but standing by a window. These corrupt governments are so evil. Kashmir is being fought over and innocent people are being killed and hurt. It really is disgusting what these governments are doing.,2
1372,Hey just wanted to write you a note and see if you have been watching the news. They are reporting finding a mass grave near mosul of 100 dead bodies most of them decapitated and some thirty three thousand people that is displaced . that is terrible. We need to do something. The US is setting up service centers families which is a great idea.,2
1373,"An endangered species of polar bears have seen an increase in the number of them killed by visitors, or hunters. Look at how the people are apparently organizing against the threat to these wonderful, and endangered creatures. I'm not sure if they can turn the tide, there are a lot of bad people out there who hunt for sport, but they can surely slow it down, and that's a good thing. I hope their efforts are strong enough that this wonderful species can be preserved, intact, in their natural habitat.",0
1374,That really crazy that a woman would actually push another person on to train tracks based off a disagreement. I get that you guys don't agree with something but that doesn't give you the right to take a persons life. I feel so sorry for the victims family because they lost a valuable family member over some petty dispute that would probably be forgotten the next day. Truly a tragic story that should be a learning situation for anyone with a disagreement with another individual.,0
1375,"Sleep is very important, and I’m quite sure you know that already. However, some aspects of life–like habits, even smartphones, and stress in work–affect our sleep cycles. A CDC-backed study published in February of this year has found that about a third of Americans aren’t getting enough sleep.Multiple factors affect the country’s snooze patterns, and one of which is routine. Many people, researchers at the CDC say, are not prioritizing sleep.So how can you force yourself to go early in bed? Well, this new research that we’ll discuss might convince you to review your priorities and put sleep above many, because you still can.",2
1376,The whole situation with Dr. Luke and Kesha got way out of hand. I feel so bad for Kesha because she simply became a victim of the music industry and lost her voice in the process. Dr. Luke should be ashamed of himself for treating Kesha so badly and trying to make her into something that she wasn't. I'm glad that she got the help that she needed and is making strides toward her own recovery.,2
1377,"If this was a hate crime that really sucks.  If this was just a bar brawl that ended very badly ... still sucks.  I don't understand why the police are being so secretive about things.

Please, cops, release some info.",2

Factors that contributed are the increase of temperature due to Global warming and Humans destroying them.The articled stated that half of the Great Barrier Reef corals are now dead from 2016-2017.

1379,"It's a shame that we have so many random acts of violence in this country.  It seems every other week we have some massacre involving either guns, a right wing extremist or a muslim extremist.  I think what they have in common are either mentally ill people or people who are extremist in their world views and religion.",0
1380,"Heyy! Although this story is sad, I found it definitely alarming and should serve as an example on how this obsession with selfies needs to stop. Apparently, a guy was killed by a python because he was trying to take a good selfie. I think he was one of those people who like to take selfies doing something daring",0
1381,"you can't sleep too much or too little. What else is new. I'm sure there will be a high priced drug that can solve this issue.

1382,"Passing this article along to you because I know you will think this is absurd. Gay men are not being allowed to donate blood to the victims of the Pulse Nightclub shooting. Isn't that crazy! Apparently, outdated rules put them at high risk for HIV and they can not donate for fear of spreading HIV. This is super discriminatory as HIV is not just found in gay men. People instead should be appropriately tested for HIV.",2
1383,"Well here is another story about the dangers of selfies. I'm mystified by this ""fad"" of selfies. I have never even thought about taking one. But maybe thats just my age or generation. Anyhow another idiot taking a selfie got attacked by a snake. Seems like selfie taking affects the brain or at least the part of brain. I have heard about people getting in fatal car crashes while taking selfies, and falling off a cliff, and being fatally attacked by bears, lions, etc etc. Now a python.",0
1384,"There has been more fighting from the Saudis in nearby Yemen.  The United States continues to supply the Saudis with weapons and intelligence, despite the atrocious use they will be put to.

1385,"The situation in Syria is really shocking. I just read an article about how the regime in power together with Russia is bombing schools and relief caravans. They deny it and Russia and China vote against sanctions at the UN. It's hard to understand what could be behind this outrage. Fortunately, there is Human Rights Watch which has done extensive and careful documentation of the most recent school bombing, and there is some effort to get individual acts treated as war crimes through UN channels.",2
1386,This is really a moving story and I could see it being motivating for a lot of women. They can realize that anyone can be at risk for cancer. It doesn't matter whether you are a favour actress or an ordinary person. It can be devastating to families and often affects them in many different ways. Such stories should be more accessible to give people hope.,2
1387,"I had no idea there is a stunning process when killing chickens, but it makes sense. Unfortunately it seems to not work very well.

1388,"It looks like chaos in Iraq.  The Islamic State (IS) has taken over Mosul and people are getting the hell out of there.  The problem is, there is nowhere to go.  There are a few camps for refugees but not nearly enough space.  People are even taking there sheep which can’t be helpful…  The IS has had people under their rule for almost 3 years and the people are making a run from it.  No doubt they have every reason – the young women and girls feel veil-less freedom!  The IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.  The were right to leave as the city is now a war zone with Iraqi security forces retaking the city.  It is a bitter fight with the usual “blood will spill” messages rampant. Many families are leaving and there are some really heart-wrenching tales. SO SAD… Many are in fear.",2
1389,HOpefully this fighting ends soon its getting to be too much the negative impact is getting bigger and bigger. If things dont stop before long then the fighting wont be in that area itll spread even wider as all the larger countries get involved and the fighting just wont stop. maybe we should start a petition or something to get some attention on this issue,0
1390,Crazy things are happening in Afghanistan still...don't want to go there anytime soon. Too unstable and too many people getting kidnapped...and that would certainly suck.

1391,"I have a lot of sympathy for everyone worried about the Trump administration. I get it. They're not wrong to be worried. I think the author of this article misidentifies the source of the problem, though. It's not Trump. Trump himself isn't why we're in this situation. It's the people and institutions who supported him and the people and institutions who were ineffective at combating him that deserve the lion's share of the blame.",0

They were saying how the town is a virtual ghost town and workers weren't allowed to go back until they check the building further.

I don't even know how you would begin to process all of this.",2
1393,"It does seem a little disrespectful when someone starts to deface any public property.  It is a disgrace and a lack of moral character when something like this happens.  No one in their right mind would think of doing this could it could land you in jail for starters.  Secondly, you could get sued and in today's litigious society you could go broke rather quick, even with a good lawyer.    I guess that's why we have laws.

1394,"When you are a police officer there is a high chance you'll get shot, this kind of thing happens because people have an easy access to guns, if there was a more strict gun control, less officers would die during their service, but well, the government prefer guns over people's lives. poor officers, but they had a risky job.",0
1395,I think that global warming is definitely a very real thing that is occurring today and I feel like it is sad that there are still people who try to deny the fact that it is a very real thing. Sometimes I feel like the people that disagree with scientists and real evidence that global warming is very obvious today is just very ignorant and live in a bubble where they think that everything is fine in the world and everyone is at peace. There are so many reasons why we should be using fewer resources as it is constantly destroying our environment and it is unfortunate that there are people who just continue to deplete our resources without a care in the world. Maybe the effects won't be felt as much in our generation but I am sure that the effects will be felt by those others after us sadly.,0
1396,I just read an article about wild fires sending a smokey haze across the state near the Appalachian mountains. Can you imagine how big the fire must be to spread so far and wide?

1399,"Wow - this is so so horrible! I can't even begin to understand why Syria would attack its own citizens, and why would Russia support them in doing so?

Its time to get these people out of office and to punish the companies and people that have allowed this to happened to the innocent children of America.  We need more regulations not less.",0
1401,I am at shock for what I have just read. First of all I would need a lot of time to reflect on what just transpired in the article I read.

1406,I can't believe what I just read. I read this article about how riot police took down some pipeline protestors in North Dakota. The armed police used such violent and aggressive tactics to take down the protestors. The protestors were Native Americans and environmental activists. Being environmental activist ourselves could you imagine how we would react to being treated this way. They used sonic devices and rubber bullets shooting the protestors in the face. I'm outraged by these actions. This is totally uncalled for and violates several codes of conduct. The cause of the protest was that the pipeline was affecting the local's water supply. I don't blame them for protesting one bit. The actions and the engagement by the riot police of North Dakota was shameful and they should be punished.,0
1407,I just read an article about an elementary school volunteer producing child porn with kids as young as NINE. This is absolutely disgusting. How can anyone violate our sweet children like that. He gave out cell phones and used an anonymous social media app to solicit videos and photos of boys and girls performing sexual acts :( I am so perturbed that people are so disgusting. I can promise you if this ever happens to any of my kids they are going to be a very sorry person.,0

1410,"When will this world learn that rape is wrong, regardless of the context?  Too many women are treated as an object, then punished by the system afterward.

1412,"Well, this certainly is rich and pathetic. The Muslims and their terrorist mouthpiece Council on American-Islamic Relations are all whiny that someone tried to do to them what they have been doing to everyone else all over the world.

1413,I think that it would a great thing if all students could get connected to the internet. The internet will provide them ways to learn more and it will help them further their education as well.

1414,"I know people tend to get really angry at law enforcement when a shooting or bombing doesn't get prevented, but I feel like it is way too complicated of an issue. I just read and article about it, and for law enforcement to keep enough information and follow enough leads to prevent every attack, we would need to sacrifice a lot of our civil liberties. It is just not worth it.",0
1415,"I kind of felt a little angry reading this article.

Man, they really have it pretty bad with all of the stuff going on. I feel really bad for the people who are living there that really don't want any part of what is going on. Could you imagine having dinner and a missile comes flying over your house? I am definitely glad I live where I live.",2
1417,"It always upsets me when I read articles about land conflicts involving Native American tribes, especially when it involves oil pipelines. I fully support expanding domestic oil operations so as to better establish energy independence, but care should be taken to respect the needs of others when developing pipelines. It may be expensive to ensure environmental care is taken and, when necessary, to reroute the pipelines to avoid encroaching on sacred lands, but that doesn't mean it's not worth the expense.",2
1418,It's shocking how little people care about this and how little Africa gets mentioned in the news. This is horrific when you think about the number of victims and the people who are harmed.

Doctors are overly calm about the things they prescribe to people, people that young shouldn't be subjected to that, and the death tolls aren't surprising.",2
1421,"After reading the article about Azalia Banks and Russell Crowe, I must say it was rather humiliating. They treated her really bad. I felt compassion for her. I tried to put myself into her shoe and I know I would have broken down and cried. She should have controlled her tongue as well, violence begot violence and a soft answer turns away wrath. Russell is not much of a lady's gentleman he could have dealt with the issue in an amicable manner. Maybe they could just let bygones be bygones and put it behind them. It was rather unfortunate.",2
1422,Remember that story that I told you about my neighbor Paul from my old neighborhood and how he had served in IRAQ and had come home and had PTSD?  I found this article that explains it pretty good and think you might be interested in reading it to deal with the new coworker that you have that has similar issues.,2
1423,IT is just sad that someone would think this is an acceptable way to resolve any problem.  He clearly needed more help than he was getting and it is unfortunate that it was recognized that he needed help or the mother didn't take steps to leave sooner.  I guess in life sometimes you just can't tell what is going to happen or what will set someone off.,0
1424,I think timeshares are silly and this article just confirms it. In the article it talks about how hard it is for some people to get rid of timeshares after they have them. Timeshare salesmen are so pushy when you first sign up for one I can't imagine how hard it is to get out of one. I'm just glad that I don't have a timeshare and never will. I'm sure they have some many tiny provisions in their contracts that make them really difficult to get out of successfully.,2
