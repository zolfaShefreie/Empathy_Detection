# Textual Empathy Detection
Train new transformer-based models for Text level and Conversation level empathy detection:
- [Text level empathy detection](https://github.com/zolfaShefreie/Textual_Empathy_Detection/tree/main/text_model): Text is given to the transformer-based model to predict one of the outputs of "empathy-seeker", "empathy-provider" and "none".
- [Conversation level empathy detection](https://github.com/zolfaShefreie/Textual_Empathy_Detection/tree/main/conversation_models): Conversation is given to the transformer-based model to predict one of the outputs of "empathetic" and "not_empathetic".
